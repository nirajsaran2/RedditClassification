5,Shin splints and knee problems,"Hi!

I [23F] started C25K about 3 weeks ago, and had been repeating week 1 as I‚Äôm yet to be able to complete all the running sessions.

However, last week, I went for a run and after my second 60 second run, my shins were incredibly sore. I tried the next burst, but it was too sore, so I walked the rest. I gave myself 5 days to rest, but my next attempt was about the same, if not worse.


Prior to my second attempt I bought expensive running shoes with good arch supports in them, and I always do 15-20 mins of warm up stretching. As of yesterday, simply walking has my shins and knees unnaturally sore.

Can anyone advise as to how I can heal whatever is wrong with my bones, I don‚Äôt want to lose momentum with the running as I‚Äôm keen to get more fit.",C25K,1644170768,teacup-tempest,0,1,True,2022-02-06

I‚Äôm doing stretching afterwards but it doesn‚Äôt seem to help much. Any advice on this?

16,Returning after a six month break,"During the height of the pandemic I got really into running.

I‚Äôm June 2021, I ran a 5k in 24:56, and I‚Äôve never been more impressed by my progress. 

Since then I moved away and got a new job which is decidedly more sedentary than before, and allows me to work from home, which has been dreadful for my step count. Last year I was reliably hitting my step count of 14,000 every day, whereas now I‚Äôm lucky to pass 2000 during the week. 

This weekend just passed I decided enough was enough and I‚Äôm getting back into running, but going out and finding all the progress of last year gone is wildly demoralising.

18,My experience of learning to love my body through diet and exercise after years of self loathing and esteem issues :),"Hi all :)

I have always struggled with my body shape and confidence for as long as I can remember. I know it probably sounds stupid but I have always hated the size of my butt as it is far too big. This has led to a period of depression where my body confidence issues impacted on all areas of my life. I recently graduated university and moved into a house share in London as I have started a Graduate Job in the city. I live with the two most amazing housemates (and now close friends I ever could have asked for), James and Sophie. I shared with them my experience of body confidence issues and self-esteem issues and they have just been so supportive and kind and helping me to come out of my shell.

We have started cooking healthy meals together and getting out exercising together which has had such a dramatic impact on my mental health and the way I view my body. My housemate James is a keen Parkrunner and has even (somehow!!) managed to get me to complete my first ever Parkrun and first ever 5K on Saturday!! I am honestly shocked that I managed to complete the Parkrun as I am 100% the last person who would ever go out running. The volunteers and team at Bushy Park are amazing!

Getting across the finish line sparked a new found confidence in myself - I won't let my lack of body confidence bring me down. I am worthwhile and I can finally get on living with my life. Everyone's body is different and I shouldn't be ashamed of mine :)

After Parkrun (and deciding to write up this post) I thought that it would be a cheeky but cool way to show off my new found mentality and confidence by posting the picture below and step WAY out of my comfort zone - my self esteem issues can kiss my butt. I have nothing to be ashamed about my body.

As a funny side note my phone stand was broken so I couldn't take a proper selfie, my housemate Sophie is away for the weekend so I had to go and awkwardly knock on my housemate James's door and strangely ask ""Would you be able to quickly take a picture of my bare butt for reddit?"" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è luckily he saw the funny side and obliged, so thank-you to James for being my spontaneous photographer and taking the pic below!

Sorry for the rambling post! Just trying to put my thoughts into words.  I have joined a running club and I cannot wait to get back out there :)

Lots of love to you all,

21,Joy despite disability,"I just wanted to post something that I‚Äôve been happy about recently. I have EDS, so my running journey is‚Ä¶ highly variable, but I just kind of realized that I‚Äôm really happy with it. It‚Äôs been about 3 years since I started trying to get into running again seriously, and in that time I‚Äôve been back and forth between a 27 minute 5k and struggling with W2/R1*10. Right now, I‚Äôm sort of hanging out in the range of W1/R3*12, which I‚Äôm doing maybe twice a week (it‚Äôs been below 0F/-15C, so my joints have been AWFUL), and it‚Äôs really cool noticing how much better I feel on a day to day basis, even if my running isn‚Äôt at all ‚Äúimproving‚Äù by the standards most people measure by. 

Like, my knees and hips don‚Äôt consistently collapse inwards with each stride, I‚Äôm able to run with my feet parallel to each other and not pointing inwards, and I‚Äôm feeling my hips and knees slipping out less and less when I‚Äôm walking around on a daily basis. 

At first, I was really wanting to be able to get into 10k‚Äôs like I did all the time in middle school (13ish years old), but while I still have a goal of running a half marathon someday, I think I‚Äôm going to be okay if that‚Äôs never going to be a reality for me. 

My docs are all thrilled and impressed by the fact that I‚Äôm able to run at all (especially my rheumatologist, who I see every six months for her to give me an hour long insurance sponsored roast. I love her), and every so often I am really disappointed by setbacks or ‚Äúlost progress‚Äù, but I kind of wanted to see if any other disabled runners have similar feelings or experiences. 

I‚Äôm 20 (AFAB, if that‚Äôs relevant to anyone) now, and I‚Äôm hoping to preserve motion and physical ability as best and as long as I possibly can. I may not have a long life expectancy, but I intend to ride it out as best as I can.",C25K,1644268247,iccryptid,0,1,True,2022-02-07

27,How to deal with pain?,"I only started running during the pandemic. I did not graduate my first attempt at C25K. Got to W7D3 and went through the sudden loss of my brother, complex grief, and fell off the wagon. Stopped in March 2021 and started over in January 2022. 

Repeated W1 a few times while trying to get my heart used to it. Got to W2D2 on Friday and on my 4th run I had this striking pain from my ankle going up my shin so I stopped and got off the treadmill. I was running at 3% incline, 5.0 mph. I am about 5‚Äù3 and slow but I almost did it once, thought I could do it again.
Usually my ankle is sore while running gets better on my rest day. Googling the symptoms seem to indicate shin splints.
I have a podiatrist appointment but that‚Äôs in two weeks. I haven‚Äôt tried running on a treadmill since Friday and the pain is still there. How do I go through this without losing progress? Do I attempt to run again despite the pain? Would HIIT be enough until I see my podiatrist?

Tried running w proper form and barely made it 4mins. So it‚Äôs October and I start over from week 1.

Then can work to 25 and eventually 30. But I just don‚Äôt think this giant jump from 8m to 20m is for me. And I‚Äôm fine w just keeping the running a habit and feeling good about my progress

51,what do I eat?,"For reference I am 18f, 125 lbs and 5'4"". Before I started running I was eating probably 1500 calories a day, and my diet was not that great (lots of pastries and chips, sometimes wouldn't eat at all).  

About a month ago I started running again, 5 days a week for 36 minutes on the treadmill (at least 2 miles each run, with 12 minutes of walking). Now I am suddenly voraciously hungry 24/7! Unfortunately, I've had some issues with disordered eating in the past, which is making me irrationally paranoid about eating. Ex. I have this nagging thought that I should be keeping a much higher calorie deficit than I am, I'm scared of ""putting on weight"" now even though I'm running, etc. 

I know I should be eating, but I'm having a hard time adjusting to my sudden increase in appetite, especially coming out of 6+ years of bad eating habits. I think having a set nutrition structure would help me feel better. So in your experience, what is a good amount to eat, assuming that I'm working to increase the distance of my runs? And what type of food should I be eating? I've been eating a lot of yogurt, cheese, nuts, meat, and rice recently, but I'd like to expand my palette if I can overcome my fear of eating more than 1500 calories a day, lol.

I suffer from mental health issues outside of this, but it's normally manageable. I find however after doing my run, especially now they are longer, that I am finding my mood really dropping and I am in a funk all day. It usually takes a few hours to kick in, so I suppose it could be endorphin drop. 

My routine atm is, wake at 0600, banana and water before I head out, stretches, water as needed on the run (I sweat a lot so its very necessary), stretch to warm down, water and light breakfast when I get home at 7:30 ish. Then I have a normal day, caffeine free tea or coffee \~mid morning, and maybe light snack, then lunch. But damn if I don't feel like crap, and I find it harder to regulate my mood.

The question is, should I be doing the squat challenge on my running days so my legs get a full rest day?   Or do the squat challenge along with the rest of the challenges on my days off of running?

70,"Legs seemed to have not been improving, but cardio has?","Hello!  I am now on W6D3 (going to do day after tomorrow) but I've been struggling with a problem since W4D1 -- my calves get super tight and feel tired after 3 to 4 minutes.  It took me two attempts to pass W5D3, which on second attempt I slowed down my pace from 10 minutes per mile down to 12 minutes per mile and that allowed me to run a little longer (just 1 to 2 minutes) before feeling tightness and fatigue in my legs.  All the meanwhile, I've not had any issues with breathing since week 4, and I was no where near out of breath on W5D3.

I've been searching online for solutions for a week now to no avail.  I've tried more static stretching and I've tried more dynamic stretches (I was always doing both since the beginning, but I thought I maybe was doing too little or needed to try new stretches).  My diet has improved drastically since beginning -- now I eat balanced meals consistently.  Hydration hasn't been a problem ever since I did a hydration challenge to get into the habit of hydrating (kept up with my hydration for 8 months straight now).  Since I had a minor injury in my left leg, I let myself rest for 4 days (on the 5th day felt great, and don't have anymore pain there), but running today felt just as exhausting on the legs as before. 

On a side note, I was running, albeit inconsistently, throughout all of last year, and just 4 months ago I could do 1.5 miles in 14.5 minutes without much issue.  Now I can't even do it in 17 minutes.  Not sure if this info helps, but here it is.

So what could the issue be?  Surely running should have gotten easier for my calf muscles by now?

91,First failure - Wasn't prepared for week 5 day 3 BUT I'm not feeling too bad about it,"I started my (first and only) C25K journey on the 1st of January of this year. I didn't know exactly what the program progression was like, I just downloaded an app and went for it. I had a few dips and bumps‚Äîa very bad flu (not covid), mental lows because I'm still recovering from the biggest breakup of my life, etc.‚Äîbut always managed to complete the days workout and perfectly respect the ""start running"", ""start walking"" commands that the app would dish out. Well, this morning I set out for a run as usual... It's -20 degrees Celcius here today, but that hasn't stopped me before. We had a big melt last week followed by a deep freeze so large parts of the sidewalk were covered in ice, I slipped a bit, but that didn't stop me. I was 12 minutes or so into the running when I started wondering when the walking would start and if my app had crashed. I took my phone out and looked at the time remaining. 8+ minutes! ""What?! When is the running going to start then? I'm already tired, how will I make it?"" Well, long story short, looking at my phone instead of just focusing on the next step and the one after was a big mistake. As soon as I started to think, I started to feel cramp up harder and my mental anguish was exacerbated. I started walking 7 minutes from the end and just walked home enjoying the sun and telling myself I'll just try again. I found this group by typing in ""c25k first failure"" and decided a little vent would do me good. In the end, I put my ego aside and logged the run/walk as an ""UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT"" in Strava. I know I will be able to scroll past it someday soon and be proud that I was honest with myself and that I didn't give up even if it was hard, even if I see people passing me every time I go out for run because of my (current) slower pace. I used to be one of those people that couldn't even run a block to catch the bus because I kept telling myself I couldn't. I'd get stuck in useless comparison loops and set unrealistic goals for myself to reach after one twenty-minute exercise session. The progress is slow, difficult and lonely‚Äîeven lonelier on Valentine's day when I think about how the unhealthy mental abyss I was in led to me losing the love of my life a few months ago‚Äîbut I am enjoying the journey because with every run, with every day that I challenge myself to just take that first step, I discover something new about myself, I prove to myself that I CAN.

I even starting training for sprint triathlons, it was a complete success. 

A few years, a couple kids and a pandemic later. Now I‚Äôm 40 pounds heavier (225 now) than I was when I was crushing it. I haven‚Äôt jogged more than a couple minutes in a couple years.

I'm also into weightlifting and I know how difficult it is to progress on lifts like overhead press, and I'd say running is right up there in difficulty.

I used to run 5k multiple times a week easy, no stopping, fastest time 23 mins (i am female and was 21-23 years old). I also ran a 10k in 48 mins.

Since this, i realised it was actually the development of an eating disorder (exercise bulimia and health obsessive eating etc)

Had to take a break from exercise to fully recover as it would trigger me.

Since this, i can barely run 15 miles mins without stopping, and i find this extremely difficult MENTALLY as if i cant go on. And i always think i will have to stop after a few mins.

I am clearly physically capable. And now i am eating properly and not underweight i should be able to do it more easily right?

No! Because ive realised its almost 70% mental rather than physical (for me)

21,C25K and the menstrual cycle,"Hi my fellow lady runners!

I wanted to share with you the knowledge that depending where you are on your your menstrual cycle your performance is different which can have influence on your way to 5k!

During the first 2 weeks ( from period to wandering egg) you are full of power and energy. The two following ones your performance drops due to hormonal changes so please don't get frustrated if you're having a dip in running performance.

I ran today W4D3 and even though it should've been easy it was pretty demanding and I almost didn't finish it today, but with the knowledge about my body and cycle I don't stress myself out and will try next time W5D1. In case this doesn't work I'll repeat W4 and then go all in with full power when my cycle is back to power mode. 

Better reaching finish line a bit later than getting hurt or injured and our bodies are just different from men's. I mean we create life, that's pretty cool but demanding.

So I started walking to there, then decided to run 2 lamposts in the park and walk 1 (very casually). And then I was increasing the distance each time I went out. This was 2 weeks ago and I ended up with something like running 500 meters than walk and then run again 500m, all in all 2K running splitted by 500m. Only yesterday I found the C25K program and now have decided to continue with it directly on week 4. 

Now to the problem, I was running for 3 days streak and day 2 I felt my both Calf being pumped after the running. Yesterday again but only on the right leg and it hurted a bit during the day. On a pain-scale 1-10 around 3, so not too much. Today I feel good, still feeling a pit pain (1). The pain started after around 500m of running (so during the run). I will take a rest day (or 2 depends on how I feel my calf).

I have an idea what the problem is (I think im running on my toes a lot) but the question really is: Is this common for beginners, and so soon?

93,Seemingly random run-ending muscle burn,"Hi reddit. I'm trying to get into running to get fitter but I randomly get intense burning that basically locks my leg/legs up. I can't figure out the cause and it's hindering my progress badly. The burn is the bottom half of my calf and underside of my foot between middle and heel.

First time it happened I ran after waking up so figured I over stressed my legs without proper warm up but it's happened several times since and I can't figure it out. I thought it might be cause of lack of stretching or not allowing enough time to recover between runs but that's not it.

I've tried running after a fast, snack, and large meal (given adequate time to digest etc). Same with hydration, same with pre-run stretching or just brisk warm up walk (NHS C25K app). Pre-workout or not. Long breaks between runs, back to back runs, walking on off days.

Does anyone have thoughts on how to work with unpredictable winter weather and missed training days?

Backstory:

I have ADHD and struggle with routine. I‚Äôll go ‚Äúall in‚Äù at first but if anything throws me off, it‚Äôs like I lose momentum and rarely finish. 

I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon with C25K twice before. Once in college when my running buddy stopped and then I stopped around week 3 or 4 then literally got off the couch to run a 5K for charity (god I miss college!) and once shortly after grad school when my running buddy stopped around week 2 and I tried adjusting my schedule and then ended up losing track of time and not following through. 

My expectations for this third try are already low. But this time I started alone, so I won‚Äôt get thrown off by anyone else. I run during daylight hours on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. I strength train in the evenings, after dark/work on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Tuesdays I chill. I don‚Äôt feel safe running in the dark or in the early mornings when I‚Äôm tired. I work a M-F 9-5 (can leave early on Thursdays if I‚Äôve banked the hours). 

Trouble is, it‚Äôs winter. I was supposed to complete week 2 today, but I woke up this morning and EVERYTHING is covered in ice with more ice/sleet/snow predicted. It‚Äôs impossible to walk without slipping‚Äî running can‚Äôt happen safely.

Starting from week 4 seemed to be ideal for me and I notice my lungs can handle it, but unfortunately the same can‚Äôt be said about my legs.

Since the first couple weeks will be easy for me I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs beneficial to start off at sprinting pace to still turn it into a challenging workout and further improve my form. I would then gradually lower my pace as I‚Äôm approaching week 4.

60,would this help,"Hi all. I've generally always been active prior to COVID. Even my job had me walking 20k a day in steps. 

This kept my weight at happy number however I work from home now so the farthest I walk is to the kitchen on lunch. 

As a result I've gained weight to 89kg. Prior to this all I was 82kg. Couch to 5k will certainly be a challenge but I've also noticed I need to change my diet. 

Would this along with a series of home workouts and a change for the better diet wise help me get my weight down or should I look into doing something else than the couch to 5k program?",C25K,1642096312,Jon199102,0,1,True,2022-01-13
61,App recommendation half marathon,"Tl;dr: looking for half marathon app with similar training plan and progression as Actives 10K app.

So I‚Äôve done c25k from Zen labs, which was okay. But when I continued on with their 10K app and the runs for one week were all the same length and intensity, it became too much and too boring. I hopped over to the 5K to 10K app from Active, which is awesome with varied runs per week (one short, one which includes tiny intervals, and one long run). 

So now I‚Äôd like to run even longer and continue training in this style, but can‚Äôt find a good app for half marathon training. On active.com there is advertisement for an app called ¬´13. One¬ª but I can‚Äôt find it in app store and I‚Äôm not even sure it‚Äôs by the same company or if it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for.

75,Hello old friend‚Ä¶ w1d1,"11 weeks ago I had a c-section that brought the most amazing little human into the world. I‚Äôd had a healthy pregnancy but we found out at 36 weeks that she was breech. Turns out there was also cord entanglement. It would have been a section however we‚Äôd approached the birth. Having major surgery was terrifying, but medical science is, well, it‚Äôs amazing. Recovery? That took time. And patience. And trust in my body. My tummy still feels weird but I‚Äôve been cleared by a doc and a physio. 

I‚Äôve run two marathons before and several half marathons. I used to run daily before work. I love running. But I stopped while pregnant because of back and SI pain. I haven‚Äôt run since May/June last year and that was a waddle. I haven‚Äôt run and felt good for over a year. I haven‚Äôt run and been good at it for about 18 months. 

Today my OH is going to take the little one for an hour and I‚Äôm going to just go for a run. Except I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm going to turn on the c25k app and follow the instructions. Because heading out without a plan is going to lead to all kinds of emotional and physical problems. I‚Äôm hard on myself. I expect a lot. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll be rubbish. I‚Äôm hopeful I‚Äôll find it easy. I know I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not the runner I used to be - I‚Äôve made a baby. So let‚Äôs see what else this body can do.

77,W7 - Can I run 11km by 25th March?,"I started the C25K in November and I am loving it. I will finish W7 today and I have plans to move to 10k once I graduate the C25K. I run every other day, so I go through weeks a bit faster than planned.

My town has a once a year marathon that allows also shorter distances so I signed up for the 5K run (would be my first since highschool).
Now they just informed me that they are scrapping the 5K option and the lowest possible one is 11K.

I am not sure what to do. Should I try it and walk whatever necessary or is it just going to demotivate me?

They do say that the police car in the back goes at 7 minutes per km and if you fall behind, you are out. I am currently running 9'/km on my good days and 11'/km on my bad ones. But, of course, in a much shorter distance. It feels like 7 minutes per km is too fast to be the slowest time allowed.

Is it worth trying to train for it or am I just going to ruin my steady plan by wanting to progress too fast?

Want to get on top of your goals this year? Join us! 

  
**What 90days is and what it isn‚Äôt**

This isn‚Äôt a set diet or exercise routine. This isn‚Äôt a competition with prizes. This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, start running, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here. The 90daysgoal community is here to support you on your journey :)

**What‚Äôs the format?**

Each Round, there's an intro thread where everyone says what they're aiming to accomplish in the 90 days. Every morning there's a daily goal thread where you can post your progress, ask questions, or read through other people‚Äôs updates. There's often a Bonus Question (BQ) to get goalies discussing and to keep us all on track. It's up to each goalie to decide how often to check-in and what their priorities are. 

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/rlnwwb/official_round_37_introduction_thread/).  **Round 37 will officially begin on January 1st, 2022**.

Today was a hard day, rainy day and sometimes we just don't wanna run but f that. I called a friend of mine who decided to start running (he's doing the C25K program as well) and we went running as per usual.   


There I was on the 4,5km-5km range as I ran by a woman walking when she surprised me by saying ""Hey, I saw you running and you motivated me to start running as well."" I was so amazed by it that I just said ""NICE!"" and went on but already thinking about what I'd say when we encounter again. A couple hundred meters after this we pass each other again and I say ""Hey, I begun my journey by walking, same as you. You can run too, believe me!"". She responded ""Oh, for real?"" and I said ""Yeah, YOU CAN DO IT"" as I went on with my running.   


I swear to god I never felt so good while running, this made me run 6km on the spot. I'm not even tired, I'm very happy because I graduated the program and motivated someone.

Spite is the best motivation.

I weighed 335 pounds (24 st., or 152kg) on July 21, 2020. A fellow comedian called me fat on stage. It was fine; it was a decently funny joke. It *was* enough to start a kayfabe-styled fake beef with him. So I publicly challenged him to a Thanksgiving 5K supporting the local food bank.

He thought that I, too, was joking. I was not. I began C25K 2 days later, on July 23 of last year. I'd gotten through about week 6 a few years ago, so I did know what I was getting into.

I ran outside. There are trails *right* by my that I'd never particularly used. We're talking 15 feet from the back of the house, on the other side of our fence. The convenience helped with the brutality of even the week 1 60-second intervals. I knew from before that every week is about the same difficulty, so week 1 was actually the scariest the second time around. I repeated a week at some point, maybe week 6. Still, I kept at it. Between this sub, the surprising variety of people who sent supportive replies to my Instagram stories, r/loseit, and r/stopdrinking (sober since 2/1/21), I made it all the way through.

I hurt my foot a little at the beginning of October, the first day I ran 5 kilometers. I couldn't run again until the beginning of November. By then it was cold. I got a gym membership at the sole local gym with a track. After all, the only thing worse than a treadmill is waiting in line for a treadmill.

The shoes I had were several years old, but only lightly used and mostly in months that start with ""Janu."" They were not designed for heavy runners. When I bought them it was because they'd sat in stock for a year. They were a special order the person hadn't ended up wanting. Nobody else wanted them: nobody else wears size 16 (EU 49). I wear size 15. The fit didn't seem terrible and they cut me a deal.

To start November, I got new shoes. They're appropriate shoes (ASICS Gel Kayano 27) for my weight, stride, and shoe size. I can't begin to tell you how much more comfortable they are. One thing that sucked was that every ""this year's top 10 fat kid running shoes"" listicle was full of a bunch of kicks that only go up to size 13.

The whole time, I kept reminding my friends that they should do it. Shown are 8 of the 9 who joined the team. 2 ran ahead, 1 ran the 10K instead, and the other 6 ran with me at my slow pace. They didn't really care about a 5K. They were just there for support.

Also, it was icy in not insubstantial spots.

You know who didn't run the race? The skinny guy who called me fat. That's alright with me. I did a thing. I accomplished a goal that was hard. My friends were there for me. Feels good.

50,Adapted C25K plan to add 3 extra weeks to level up more slowly/prevent injury ‚Äîanyone else do this? What do you think of my plan?,"Hi all, I‚Äôm currently in week 3 of C25K. I‚Äôm prepping for a 5K in mid-March so I have a few buffer weeks.

Week 6 to week 7 in the C25K plan has a more dramatic increase than I think I should do (I‚Äôm 50) so I added some weeks:

Week 6 (as prescribed by C25K):
5 min warm up, 5 run, 3 walk, 7 run, 3 walk, 5 run, 5 cool down. That‚Äôs 33 min total, 17 min of it is running.

Week 7 (as prescribed by C25K):
5 min warm up, 25 run, 5 cool down. That‚Äôs 35 min total, 25 min of it is running. (Damn that just feels like such a jump up!)

I‚Äôm going to add this:

Week 6.A:
5 min warm up, interval: 5 run, 90 sec walk‚Äîrepeat  4x total, 5 cool down. That‚Äôs 35 min total, 20 min of it running.

Week 6.B:
5 min warm up, interval: 6 run, 1 walk‚Äîrepeat 4x total, 4 cool down. That‚Äôs 37 min total, 24 min of it running.

Week 6.C:
5 min warm up, 8 run, 1 walk, 10 run, 1 walk, 6 run, 5 cool down. That‚Äôs 36 min total, 24 min of it running.

64,Keep going - it DOES get easier!,"I started running a few months ago using the C25K program. I had a terrible base level of fitness and would get puffed just running for two or three minutes (probably didn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôd try and fang it instead of pacing myself). During the first few weeks, I would constantly be searching things like ‚Äúwhen does running get easier‚Äù and ‚Äúhow long until running is fun‚Äù - I had heard that when you reached a certain level of fitness, you could just run and enjoy it and not be puffing and hurting but I didn‚Äôt fully believe it. Even after I finished the program and could run 5km, it didn‚Äôt entirely feel like that - sure, it was easier than when I started, but it still wasn‚Äôt really enjoyable (apart from a few rare runs).
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I was planning to do an easy 30m of recovery. I was jogging alongside the river, super slow, just taking in my surroundings, appreciating the cool, slightly-humid air and the peaceful morning. I was going to turn around and go back but wanting to do a loop (I hate a double-back), I decided to go a bit further so I could cross a bridge and return on the other side. I felt great: effortless, strong. I felt like I could‚Äôve kept running - so I did. I went past the street where I‚Äôd intended to end the run and just kept going, and ended up running 7km, which I‚Äôve never done before and would NEVER have imagined was possible. I could‚Äôve probably gone even further. I felt amazing - not puffed and panting and hurting and elated that the run was over, but strong and relaxed and content.
&lt;p&gt;
This was a long post just to describe one run, but it really was the run that made me realise that it actually DOES get easier. It also made me realise how far I‚Äôve come since starting C25K, and I feel really proud of myself. If anyone reads this far - especially someone who, like me, is doubting that they will ever reach that point of actually enjoying running - keep going!

80,I (31M) have been running since I was in 4th grade. I love running and I want to share my favorite 2-5 mile training layout that I got from someone I really respect. Hit my 2 mile/5K/10K/13.1M PR gliding over ice with this one.,"Try this if you want to increase your speed. It will make you run the fastest 5K of your life. You can modify this approach for any race distance. The key with training for speed is you want distance sprints, HIIT sprints and distance runs. Remember, never sacrifice form speed. There are some great videos on YouTube on form, so I implore you to go self educate on that prior to starting any running plan. ALSO, whatever your goal is, remember nutrition is just as if not MORE important than training. Protein, carbs and fat grams - TRACK YOUR MACROS AND HIT THE TRACK!

Monday : 4x400m(.25 mile) sprints. Walk the same distance (400m(.25 mile)) in between each sprint

Tuesday: 20 minutes swimming, exercise bike, any low impact cardio

Wednesday: Sprint 30 seconds, walk 30 seconds. Go 10 rounds. Walk for five minutes. Go another 10 rounds.

Thursday: 20 minutes swimming, exercise bike, any low impact cardio

Friday: Run 3 miles as fast as you can without stopping. Walk in between running if you have to stop, but run as much and as fast as you can. *MAINTAIN GOOD FORM*

Saturday &amp; Sunday: 20 minutes swimming, exercise bike, any low impact cardio

Add/modify: Increase reps only after completing this exact cycle with no breaks for 3 weeks. Build it up incrementally to where you are doing 1 mile intervals, 120 second sprints, 10 mile runs. The key is to focus on speed on shorter distances at first, and slowly build up to longer distance speed over time. You can change Sunday into a shorter low impact day with some yoga or extended time stretching sessions for recovery if you need to.

Eventually you want to lift weights on the low impact cardio days (mon wed fri run, tue thurs sat lift, sun recovery). Focus on integrating a leg day one week, then leg day and tricep/chest day next week tricep/chest day &amp; bicep/back day the the next week. If lifting is too much, go back to low impact cardio days in between the runs.

15,My experience picking up this program midway through,"Today I just finished W5D3, having started the program on W5D2 last week. 

I started running back in September, and progress was very slow. I was just doing my own thing and not using any sort of program and when I started I couldn't run more than a 1/4-mile continuously. I was running around a 1/2-mile loop, and just doing various intervals for 1.5 to 2 miles. 

After 3 months of running 2-3 times per week, I finally ran my first continuous mile (1.6K) in 10:45. That was when I started looking around the internet and came across C25K (which I had heard of before but never looked at) and this subreddit which gave me some good info.

Needless to say I was disappointed to find out my 12 weeks of effort only corresponded to roughly week 5, and even W5D2 seemed like it would be a huge stretch for me. I figured I would give it a try though, and my next run I accomplished it. 

Then like a lot of people, I was in disbelief at how quickly it escalates. Even if I managed to run 10 mins in two intervals, there was absolutely no way I would be able to do them continuously I thought. Well, on my next session (today) I managed to run for over 21 minutes.

I do have to credit this subreddit though, because what I realized after reading a bunch of posts was that the whole time I had been running too fast. I was just sort of aiming for 10 min miles, thinking anything slower than that didn't really even count as jogging. As soon as I slowed it way down from the beginning of my runs, I realized I could go much longer.

So, if you're doing this program, I would say you're on the right path. My progress was 2-3 times slower doing my own thing, and as soon as I picked this up I doubled my progress in like a week's time. Hard to argue with that.",C25K,1640032662,ArrivalVertex,0,1,True,2021-12-20

I recently bought a treadmill because it‚Äôs getting really cold outside where I live. I completed C25K a couple of months ago and made my way to jogging 40 minutes without stopping. When I first jogged on my treadmill, I felt really tired and my shins and calves became rock hard. I actually had to stop and stretch them out because they were really cramping.

I‚Äôm starting to get really discouraged and regretting my treadmill purchase.

Not one day have i regretted going for a run. 

In this short experience my advice to people who are starting out is 

1. Drink plenty of water. Like throughout the day at least 8-10 glasses, being hydrated keeps you going during the run or else you run the risk of cramps. 

2. STRETCH. I can emphasize enough on this one , spend like 5 mins both before and after the run and your body will thank you. I did this rookie mistake early on and I ended up with shin splints and an ache in the calf. There's plent of YouTube videos out there STRETCH YOUR LEGS BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE RUN.

80,Need advice on first c25k,"Hello! I‚Äôm working on my c25k progress, currently on W4D2. That said, I did miss a week or so last week- but todays run was okay getting back to it. Minus the warmup and cooldown (5min each), the workout was

Jog 5

10,"Stopped c25k due to injury, should i resume?","hey! after finishing week 5 run 3 about 8 weeks ago, i had an ankle injury and had to stop. i tried to keep active since then and went to the gym a lot, but did no cardio since that would put lots of pressure on my ankle. 
today, i tried running again for the first time: i was extremely careful where i stepped to not trip and wore an splint.
now after a few minutes of seeing where i'm at, i decided to do Week 5 run 1. during the run i was not feeling too bad and i managed finishing it. but now, after the run, my ankle is hurting again (not terrible, but uncomfortable).
a bit of a background to explain why i'm a bit conscious/nervous about this: since i was 15, until now where i'm 21, i've had an ankle injury once or
twice every year. this included ankle sprain and fractures, ranging from moderate injuries to complete ruptures. my last injury before this one was about a year ago and took 7 months and physical therapy to heal enough just for me to comfortably jump/jog for a few steps. 
i have no conformation from a doctor about this, but i'm pretty sure i have chronic ankle instability as the description that is given online matches almost 100% of my experience/current situation. 

i'm wondering whether i should resume running or just give up on it to avoid further injuries. i will obviously ask my doctor about this as well, but in the past, his advice was mostly just 'try and find out'. does anybody have a similar history/experiences?

17,I wanted to share a bit about why I'm so passionate about running and find out why you're passionate about it too!,"Back in school I always remember getting changed and a kid shouting out to everyone that I had big nipples. 

And I can remember feeling really shocked and embarrassed. This wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd thought about before until this one guy had said it‚Ä¶

And now everyone in the PE changing room was stood there laughing at me, it was horrible!

Almost overnight I became so body-conscious‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt want to take my top off anymore‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt want to go on holiday with my family in fear of having to take my shirt off on the beach‚Ä¶

And I become obsessed with going to the gym and dieting to change the way I looked.

My logic was if I was to lift weights and build muscle I could change the shape of my chest and by dieting aggressively all year round I could be super lean and have nipple like everyone else‚Ä¶

The gym, the strict diets, the obsessive nature of changing my body completely distorted the way I thought I was supposed to look.

I became so obsessed with being in shape that if my diet waivered slightly off track I‚Äôd feel like sh\*\*, and punish myself by making myself eat more and more until I reached a point of wanting to be sick.

**I had no respect for my own body anymore.**

This continued for a few years and I tried loads of different diets and training routines to stay in shape without getting the body that I wished for.

Then as I moved cities and went to university, I decided to take up running, which was originally for no other reason than to help me lose a bit of weight, keep it off, and feel comfortable in my own skin.

When I started I really enjoyed it and committed to it 3 times a week.

One thing surprised me tho and was something I wasn‚Äôt expecting‚Ä¶

Was the huge mindset shift quite early on into running.

Running had completely changed the way I was eating, training, and viewing my body. 

All of a sudden my focus was ‚Äì 

*‚ÄúHow could I be a better runner‚Äù* 

As opposed to‚Ä¶

*‚ÄúWhat should I eat and do in the gym to look better in a t-shirt‚Äù*

I feel like running gave me something else to focus on. It took away my obsessive focus on my body and weight...

It‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm now comfortable in my own skin‚Ä¶

And why I no longer have to worry about losing weight or that the weight will all of a sudden pile back on.

As well as the health benefits to running‚Ä¶ **YOU FEEL AMAZING DOING IT!** 

This is why I‚Äôm so passionate about running and why I‚Äôm on a mission to help more people reach their health and fitness goals, like being in shape‚Ä¶

Without exercise feeling like a punishment‚Ä¶

I have been able to run when I was supposed to and I end still with energy but I have covered very little distance so I might be doing it too slow. Is there a guide somewhere about distances you should be covering per week? I don't think I will make it anywhere near 5k if I run at this speed for 30 minutes. Should I repeat W1 to speed up before moving on?

I have also found out that the routine works for me as long as it is a daily activity, so I thought of running every day but my calfs seem to need more time to recover. I would not call it pain but I do feel my body from the knees down.
Could I be doing something wrong? Or is it normal when you start moving (I have done nothing for years)? I have been running on asfalt. Do I need special shoes?

And then out of nowhere, COVID put the whole world on stop.

There was a lot of uncertainty and we didn‚Äôt know if it was going to be 3 months, 6 months, or even a year before until things started to open up again.

Personally, I was thinking ‚Äì 

‚ÄúHow was this gonna work?‚Äù

I was worried that with the gym and track disappearing I was going to gain a load of weight and not be able to run as fast.

All the hard work I‚Äôd put in over the years to get to where I wanted to be felt like it could all be undone.

So me and my friend Nick decided to start training together, and with a pull-up bar, a step, and a 30kg dumbbell we got to work.

We also decided to start running together at a local park early in the morning so we wouldn‚Äôt get in anyone's way or risk getting covid.

The problem was at that time in the morning the world and his dog were out walking!

Hearing a bark in the darkness while you‚Äôre running isn‚Äôt exactly pleasant‚Ä¶

We couldn‚Äôt see where we were running and there was a couple of times where we did end up injuring ourselves on the uneven surface‚Ä¶

Plus it was cold, wet and windy and at times snowy so it was then ideal running conditions.

And I remember saying to Nick - 

‚ÄúIf you weren‚Äôt here running with me right now, I wouldn‚Äôt be‚Äù

Today I ran my 13th 3k in the snow in -16 C degrees (warm gloves, wind blocking jacket, warm beanie and studded shoes are a must) and it felt great.

I want to encourage you all and let you know it might take years and multiple attempts to do it, but don't let it depress you! The goal is just to get out there and be active. And to keep the healthy habits for the long run in your life, so it's not just a one-time glorious thing but rather a habit to keep up. It's a marathon not a sprint. The biggest blocker might be psychological if like me, since childhood you hated sports and thought that you can't do it. You can do it slowly and steady and it will be a great confidence boost once you achieve the goal and keep up the healthy habits!

46,"People yelling out ""encouragement""","So I'm having a bit of a weird issue. I finished the program a little while ago and have been running 5K a few times a week, and/or mixing in trail running with my hiking. My normal morning exercise routine for a while has been a \~5.5 loop hike, so now I'm hiking the first, uphill half and running the flats and downhill. When there are weather or time constraints, I'm stuck running streets in my neighborhood.

In the neighborhood, no one pays the least bit of attention to me. But on the trail, I regularly get hikers barking out things like, ""You go, great job!"" and ""You got this!"" Uh, yeah? Again, this is my routine, something I do multiple times a week. I'm not struggling. I'm not huffing and puffing. There is absolutely nothing of note happening.

76,Walking to running,"Hi everyone, I have a quick question and I apologize if someone asked this already.

In the past few months, I tried to reorganize myself and go to the gym, but it just didn't work out for me. The small time window that works for me in regards to less crowd in the gym is just right after work, but I'm too exhausted for that. If I'd go to the gym later in the evening it would be packed with people, and the majority of them are those people who just come to the gym to take photos and hog the machines.

So I gave up on the gym and started going for walks instead. It coincided with some tumultuous time in my personal life and it was a really good outlet for me. After a month, I improved my pace and my time, although I mostly kept the same distance. I average some 4-5km, usually in under an hour, depending on how much time do I have, is it too cold, etc. But 10k steps a day is the minimum I aim for.

My question here is - does this seem like a good groundwork for picking up running? How much longer should I keep walking before I start running? It would be an outdoor jog on concrete and asphalt since I don't have access to a proper running track (sidewalks and paved path by the river), so what should I pay attention to? Any tips on running in a cold and humid-ish climate, especially on breathing and clothing? I am overweight, but not obese, and I've been shedding kilos slowly but steadily by walking. However, I'm not looking into running only to lose weight but mostly as an exercise that would fit me well since I **really** dislike the whole gym dudebros atmosphere.

15,Looking for opinions: How I would improve C25K,"So, I've been figuring out how to build myself up to 40 mpw, and keep finding myself back in the mindset of C25K. It's an excellent program, and one I would advocate for most anyone, but I think it does have some issues that could be improved. So I'm gonna try to do so, and I'd love to hear the critiques of others. A few rules:

1) Only simple instructions. Meaning I can only say walk x, run x. I totally believe that S&amp;C is valuable at all points of running, but that gets too complex. Additionally, I'd love to give cross training instructions, but that's not allowed either.  
2) Graduation is actually running a 5k, and I want to set up good habits as much as possible given rule 1.

Before I begin, I want to disclaim that I am not a coach, trainer, elite runner, or even good runner. I'm just a random on the internet who thinks he can slightly improve an immensely successful program.

First, some golden bits of C25K. 3 runs/week is perfect, as is the 5 min walking warm up and cool down. I won't be touching those.

I will however be adding two things to the core structure. First, I'll be adding 2 optional walks per week. These will start at 20 mins and will climb to 30 mins. I believe that dedicating 5 days to exercise, even at this phase, is a good idea. Normally, I would recommend S&amp;C or cross-training here, but that's not allowed. Second, I'll be adding 0.5 weeks. The idea of these is to have people jump back less than a full week if they are having trouble or not completing the run. (So if you can't do W4, you jump back to W3.5 and try W4 next week. Similarly, if you can't do W1, you go back to W0.5) This also allows people to move more slowly through a more granular program if they choose to.

Without further ado, my improved C25K. Runs in parentheses are optional walks. Warm up and cool down are implied.

W0.5: 6x 1r2w / 6x 1r2w / 6x 1r2w (/20w/20w)

Some details on the changes I made:

* Week 1 and 2 are unchanged, but I did add a W0.5 for those who are not quite ready to start W1. Unlike none2run, I want people to run for 1 minute even in this early stage, as it's much harder to sprint for 1 min. 
* Week 3 can be a hard jump to make, so I added a W2.5 that focuses on getting comfortable with less recovery time and larger distance while not needing to do both simultaneously. I also made W3D3 slightly harder to allow for a smaller jump between W3 and W4.
* W4 was a hard one to figure out. I understand that it is designed to incorporate the gains of 3+ weeks of steady running, but it still felt like a big jump. I ended up adding a half minute to recoveries after the 5 min run. W3.5 is actually really simple - it's just a bridge between the last run of W3 and the first run of W4.
* I did not touch W5. It is perfect, and everyone deserves the thrill of going from 5 mins as your longest run to 20 mins within a single week. I also didn't touch W6, because it is also well-designed.
* I added a more intense version of W6 as W6.5 in case the bridge to running without rests proves too hard.
* W7 and beyond have been restructured to something that you would see in other plans, and ends you pretty close to the first week of Hal Higdon's Novice 10k plan. I lowered the mileage of the first two days of each week and increased the last day, simulating two easy runs and a long run.

Well, that's a long post, made mostly for my own satisfaction. I'd love to hear other's thoughts on this, or how they would change the program. If people are interested in how I would do a B210K program, I can also post that later.",C25K,1636414469,reylee12,7,1,True,2021-11-08

31,"Had to change to treadmill recently, feels harder than outside","Without doxxing myself hopefully,

I was running outside on rural roads and pathways before up and down hills. As it's coming up to winter these roads are soon gonna become as icy as fuck and potentially dangerous I think so recently I signed up to he gym to run on treadmills. Now I'd been out the routine a little for a bit so it wasn't ever going to be super smooth sailing but running on a treadmill feels way harder than it ever did outside.

I think it's because I can't like, regulate my own pace automatically anymore. Before I'd naturally slow down as I went up the hill and then speed up after the hill. 

Maybe something to do with the scenery not changing as well? And the obnoxiously loud gym music.

I mean I'm gonna keep going and trying but it's frustrating that I got used to at least getting near to 5k ran each time if not actually reaching it to barely able to handle 2k.

Has anyone else had the same problem?

I‚Äôm (27F) quite a fit person but, I‚Äôve found that when I‚Äôm running (and resting) I end up having constant throat/chest/rib cage pain.

My GP/doctor told me my sats are fine and my chest sounds clear. Essentially I have to ‚Äúdeal with the pain‚Äù because there is nothing wrong with me.

31,Encountered a Setback - Looking for Advice,"Finished w6d1 on Thursday and killed it.  Ran through my cooldown because I was feeling really good.   

Thursday night and Saturday felt the normal soreness ive been feeling but nothing worse then normal.

Started my w6d2 on Saturday morning and did my 5 min warm-up. About 5 min into my run started feeling pain in my right knee and every step was harder than the last. Went about a third of a mile and had to stop because of the pain. Walked home and it hurt (not just sore).

Pain goes away if I take a break from walking but comes back when I walk extended distances.  Took the voys trick or treating today and by the end it was pretty bad.

Clearly not running tomorrow and pretty disappointed.  My self diagnosis is ""runner's knee"" but thinking about going to my general practitioner to take a look.  

Is this just me doing""too much too soon""? Bad luck? Not a big deal?

40,"W1D1, first run since I got Covid. Longer post because I'm a good emotional mess right now","God I missed this feeling of good exhaustion and pride after after run :D  

So last year I started C25K as a complete and absolutely loved how so much easier it made running for me. I posted here regularly about my progress and was doing very well to finish it.

My last post I was at the beginning of week  8. It was the first really bad run I had, I couldn't find a food rhythm and had to stop several times in between. You all assured me it was completely normal, and that it even happens to pros. I was in good spirits that I would do the run again and succeed this time.

Four days later I got a dry cough. Then fever. Then I lost my sense of smell. I literally don't know how, but I got Covid. And despite having a relatively mild cause, it still knocked me out for four weeks straight. The one moment I was running 20 minutes straight, the next I had to lie down after walking to the bathroom and back. Within not even two weeks.

And it got worse. Covid got to my heart. In January I spent a week at the hospital. Ever since then it has been a very slow, but fortunately steady recovery for me. My heart is unfortunately still ill. Much, much better,  but still not healthy again.

Now, after finally getting my vaccine and receiving breathing therapy for my chest pain, I have been finally feeling like my old self again. Still exhaust super quickly, but that is mainly because I barely moved within the last 10 months to not stress my heart. That of course also ment no running.

And I missed running. I mean not running per se, let's face it, I don't particularly enjoy running. But I missed the outside. I missed the feeling of being active and healthy. I missed how impressed I was with myself for actually pulling through with running three times a week. I missed the feeling of my running shoes. But mostly I missed feeling good about myself.

So now, after I had four pretty good weeks, I decided to go for C25k again. Of course I had to start at zero, considering I basically had no stamina. Put my shoes on, found the right music, started the app. And told myself to take it as easy as possible. If I just felt a tiny bit of pain in my chest I would stop.

I thought I would make it through the first 4 runs. But no, I made it through all 8. The last two were hard, because my legs were tired, and I am definitely really gonna need the rest day tomorrow, but I made it.

It has been a rough year. But right now, lying on my couch and my heart feeling normal despite gettingits hardest workout in almost a year, I may be crying a bit of joy and pride.  Finally I am back.",C25K,1635791223,yetanotherowl,13,10,True,2021-11-01

63,W1D2 of my fitness journey and C25K,"Hello everyone! First post here and I can't wait to learn this new way of life.

Context: 28m/280lbs 

I started my fitness journey at the beginning of march. I actively played football and joined a weight loss league and started my journey from there. I'm a smoker and actively reducing my bad habit with the will to stop. I got a couple of injuries in the summer through football and my job, but I could feel myself getter fitter and fitter every week. 

6 weeks ago I broke my clavicle bone in my shoulder while playing football and had surgery. I'm on the mend but struggle considerably with my arm and shoulder. Though during this time I sorted out my diet to a place where I am happy with it.

I started my C25K yesterday. I'm doing everyday twice. In an effort to reach 10,000 steps, and to push myself as I can no longer do anything gym related or football related. I take the first set quite slow, and stretch accordingly. Then push myself through the second set. So far so good and I'm loving how I feel afterwards. I cannot wait to do my first run in a couple of months.

2,Calf strain in week 2,"Hi all. Just sharing my difficulty in case someone else struggling with the same thing. I had just found my pace after going too fast in week 1, and was really looking forward to making progress, when I found I couldn't walk properly anymore owing to pain in my right leg which started the day after completing w2r1. No problems on the run, just started hurting the day after, still quite stiff now more than a week later. üòí

Wasn't really expecting such a thing this early in the programme! I cycle to work every day and walk a lot so didn't think my legs were that bad. I got a gait analysis and bought proper shoes before starting, so thought I had covered the bases. Disappointing.

Can't run for now, so have started doing one of Mark from none2run's strength workouts for runners. Hopefully once the leg gets better I'll be able to start again with stronger muscles and get further through c25k. Really hope so, I was just starting to get into it!

Any tips/experience welcome.

After taking some time off and getting into biking, I decided to get back into it and try again. Before I started running, I went and got some new shoes from the local running store. I pronate really badly, so the dude there recommended the Brooke Beasts, which feel pretty good. They're a little stiff and make my feet ache a bit, but they feel much better than the awful Nike's I used to run in.

I did the first day alright (actually made it through without being horribly out of breath), and then made it through Day 2. I did Day 2 after about 3-4 days of rest. I felt alright after my run on D2, but my shins were hurting just a bit. Overall not too bad though, but I might've pushed myself to run a little too hard. I tried to lift my hips forward and strike under my shoulders, but I did put more effort in if that makes sense.

Today (day after Day 2) my shins hurt a **ton**, they're fine when I'm sitting but when I put too much weight on them (especially on my left) they hurt pretty badly. The only thing I can think of is that I've been running on a trail near me that's concrete / asphalt, and that maybe I should run on grass or something?

Just wanted to pp in here and ask if anyone has adapted the c25k  program to suit their complete inexperience?

I have literally never run that in my entire life, even in childhood at my absolute peak fitness, even when I was playing 3 sports (often hindered by asthma). 

I am planning for splitting it up like week 6: 8-5-8 then week 7: 10-3-10, and every subsequent week increasing one of the two runs by 2 minutes, then adding 2 minutes run time to each one until I am eventually running for 30 minutes. It'll take me 17 or so weeks instead of the 9, but I just think it will be far more achievable. 

Did anyone else plan ahead and do this?

Have been running continually for 1.5 months now. 

It started week 5 day 3. I made it through the 20 minutes and was super proud of myself, but shortly after I finished the run I got debilitating cramps in the lower part of my body. I stumbled home and waited 15 min for them to go away. 

I took 3 days rest and continued with week 6. since then the longest I could run was 15 minutes, afterwards I just can‚Äôt keep going. I attempted week 6 day 3 (23 min) 2 times and then I went back to Week 6 day 2 (2x 10 min). I have been doing day 2 for an entire week now and it still feels extremely hard, can barely finish each time.

I have noticed that just about every time I run, I have random parts of my leg sore throughout the entire run. I am worried that I am not getting a good cardio workout because I often have to run at a super slow pace, not due to lack of breath, but due to my calves being sore, or my ankles being sore.

I have been fitted for proper running shoes, have solid running form (corrected by a competitive runner friend) and am always well hydrated/stretched before running. I do most of my running on the road if that makes a difference.

I wanted to start cardio (and lose a few kgs) and decided to start running/jogging.

I'm getting back into weight lifting and plan to do 3x full body workouts a week. Will this interfere with the running plan of this subreddit?

Before I found this sub I did a jog 4 times with a day of rest in between each jog. I do 2 songs of warm up walk, 5 songs of jogging and 2 songs of cool down walking.the middle part is always very hard and by the end of it there is no way i can jog any more. i'm wondering should i still start on week 1 of the running plan or a bit ahead like week 2 or 3?

songs I listen to are usually 2:30-3:00 minutes long, I use them because it tells me how far along the jog i am without looking at the phone

The first time, I bought a running watch to help me track intervals, but if I remember correctly it was only full minute intervals, and you couldn't vary lengths for walks/runs...

I have a very basic mp3 player that also has a limited timer feature on it, so I've been trying to use that, but again it's not exactly what I need. 

I'm trying to run as light as possible - I don't bring my smartphone, mostly out of anxiety that I'll drop/break it - so I was considering getting another fitness tracker or cheap running watch. But perhaps there's a solution I'm overlooking? What do ya'll do in this case?

72,"Anyone Have ""Blah"" Days?","Quick background: In the last 12 months I started and finished c25k, ran 5km once or twice a week, hit my major goal of doing a 10km run before a major surgery, had surgery and didn't walk for about 6 weeks, slowly got back to it and about a month ago did first post-op 5km run and then last week did a PR 5km run (31min, still working to get under 30). 

I get hyped and excited for when I have a ""longer"" (5km) run planned. I prep for it throughout the day, try to get rest, don't run the day before, hydrate throughout day, eat properly, etc. I was all set to go on Saturday for a nice run, did my routine and get out there. After 1km I start to feel so tired and lack of energy. No motivation or energy to continue and really feeling like nothing is in the ""tank"". I ended up stopping at 2km because I was so freaking exhausted and felt miserable. I was so angry and frustrated. Alternated walk/run back home. There are some days when I start and I feel good after the first 5 minutes and KNOW that I can hit 5km but then I have days the opposite as well where I feel horrible early on and it just goes downhill.

91,Was unwell and took a week off - can I complete Week 7 as 4 runs over 2 weeks?,"Thanks so much this supportive community. I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice. 

I very much started from the couch - I‚Äôd had a few years of inactivity due to some health problems that have now improved. 

I run on Tues or Weds, Fri and Sun. Unsure if ok to have 2 days in between but it‚Äôs not possible to go on other days. 

I completed runs 1-20 fine and felt so proud and motivated. Then got the horrible cold that‚Äôs going round and took a week off from running - felt lousy and wanted to avoid injury and/or failing and damaging my confidence. 

I feel better now. Just repeated run 20 (7 days after previously doing it) and felt fine. I‚Äôd appreciate advice on what to do next.

**Option 1: go onto run 21 then start week 8**

Week 7 is 3 x 25 mins. This would be 4 x 25 mins over 2 weeks instead. So I won‚Äôt have done week 7 ‚Äòproperly‚Äô but I also won‚Äôt lose momentum or confidence. I feel ready to go up to 28 mins, so this is my preferred option but is it unwise?

**Option 2: start my ‚Äòrunning week‚Äô today**

So redo run 20 *again* next time and then go onto week 21. This is probably the most sensible idea but feels frustrating and demotivating. 

**Option 3: go onto run 21 but then repeat week 7 next week**

Honestly, I am likely to give up if I try to do this.

97,"Week 9 Day 3 done - I'm not finished, I'm just getting started!","Just to give everyone some background, I'm a 43 year old 6'3"" 227lb. male. I was actually down to about 217lbs. when I started this program. My final stats are 69 total miles (should be 70 at least, app messed up at the beginning of one run). 14 hours 46 minutes of running, 10,463 calories burned. 

I was athletic in high school and spent a little time in the military but this was almost 20 years ago. My son started cross country this year and I decided to help him train - only problem was I couldn't make it around the block without stopping. 

My advice: 

There will be days you don't want to run. I focused on how great I felt after the run to make myself run  anyway. It literally is a game changer in my day now - I not only run in the morning before work but I run a mile at lunch time as well. I'm to the point to where I want to start running on my off days as well. 

Buy some shoes - don't just go buy a pair of shoes at a big box, go find a run shop and get fitted for them. I've never been a person to spend a lot of money on shoes. I don't buy cheap ones but I typically don't spend more than 75 dollars on a pair either. But after about 3 to 4 weeks I went to my local running store and dropped $130 on a pair of Brooks that fit me. My Brooks Ghost 14's fit me better than any shoe I've ever owned.

Next steps:

I think I'm going to start the 5k to 10k program next. I've registered to run a 5k with my son on Halloween and looking forward to that. If any C25K alumni have any advice on what to do next I'm all ears.

I downloaded the C25K app today and tried the first day, but I couldn't even do that. I'm 25 y/o female, 171cm and around 83kg, but I can walk for hours with no issues. It's like my legs don't get tired but my chest does. 

I know you have to build up to it, but I have been walking a lot and today was really demoralising. I've never run before or done any kind of exercise that wasn't walking really. I want to learn and to get healthier but my mental health is also really poor these days and I read a lot about how running can improve that, and I'd like to work on my fitness and weight as well. 

When I was running I couldn't go for more than 30 seconds max without feeling like I couldn't get my breath. It made me a bit nauseous as well and made my chest hurt. I went back to walking, and then tried again but the same thing happened again.

Today has made me feel a bit useless and afraid to go out again, it took me weeks to stop worrying about being looked at when I went out, and then when I finally did go I couldn't even do it. 

I don't know if anyone here has had similar experiences and pushed through them? Or if there's any tips/support out there? I live alone and I've not got anyone to talk to about this, really. I know it's only my first day but I've been suffering from depression and anxiety a lot lately and it took me so long to build up to even trying to improve myself.

BUT.....

I decided to check my apple watch to look at all my previous runs to see quantitative progress. I found that my max heart rate during each run was decreasing with almost every run!

\- W1D1 on Monday, then 1.5h Padel on Thursday

\- W1D2 on NEXT monday, then Padel on Thursday... And so on, for 24 weeks.

Keep in mind I also walk quite daily.. So it wont be 100% rest during all my ""rest days"".

17,Couch to Marathon (half way there),"As a recent graduate of C25K, a big thanks to everyone in this community for your help and support.  Once I graduated, I had a big ""what next"" type of question, so I moved from C25K to B210K (5k to 10k), but then as I approach the end of B210K, I'm again asking myself ""what next"".  So my next goal will be 10k to Marathon.  So if anyone is wondering how far to take it, here's my suggested training from Couch to Marathon.  Personally, on my journey from Couch to 10k, I never keep to schedule.  I have frequent restarts and skips so it always takes me 10% to 20% longer than the schedule dictates.

* [Couch to 5k](http://tombenninger.com/files/2011/09/VisualC25K.v1_0b.png) - 9 week program with 3 runs per week.
* [5k to 10k](https://i.imgur.com/3oAWVtd.png) - 6 week program with 3 runs per week.
* [10k to Marathon](https://www.halhigdon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Novice-1-Marathon-Printable.pdf) - 18 week program with 4 runs per week.  Half Marathon is at the 8 week mark if you want to stop there.

So in summary, you can do Couch to 10k in 15 weeks, and Couch to Half-Marathon in 23 weeks, and Couch to Full-Marathon in 33 weeks.  But again, I would add at least a 20% buffer to those schedules for restarts.  Plus since I'm consistently below the 10 min/mi assumptions I spend some time at the end of each program to ensure I hit the distance as well as the time based goals.

If you are trying to hit a specific date for an event, ensure that you know the pacing requirements of half marathon and marathon events.  Many of the races I've seen require a 15 min/mi or faster pace.  This is a challenging pace for me, since I usually get slower as I go further.",C25K,1633011837,brianddk,6,1,True,2021-09-30

Due to some long-term health problems I was pretty inactive and very much starting from the couch. The idea of running for even 10 minutes seemed ridiculous but I figured I‚Äôd trust the programme and go with it.

I completed week 6 today. I postponed one run due to torrential rain but have otherwise stuck to every planned run and fully completed them all. I felt great when I did the 20-minute run on the first try. I started to notice other differences, like when I jogged home from the bus stop because it was raining and didn‚Äôt get out of breath.  

I kept saying I was going to run for time, not distance, and worry about the distance once I‚Äôd completed the programme - to treat it as couch to 30 minutes. I wish I‚Äôd stuck to that. 

For today, the first 25-minute run, I tried Runkeeper just to see. I felt so great when I completed it. I find having a good playlist really helps and I‚Äôd planned this one really well (eg energetic songs at points where I was likely to flag). I felt so good when I finished. 

And then I looked at Runkeeper and it said 3.75km. This includes the 5-minute warm-up and cool-down walks as I started it beforehand (I don‚Äôt take my phone out of my running belt).

I'm on week 5 of the program and while I've found it challenging I'm really enjoying myself! Today I did Week 5 Day 2 which was 8 minutes of running, 5 walking, 8 running. It was hard for me at times mentally, but I did it. I was slow as hell, but I did it. 

The next run, which I plan on doing Thursday, is straight forward: warm up and then run for 20 minutes. I'm scared and excited. Running for 20 minutes straight in my mind, for whatever reason, will finally make me a real runner. I want to keep running long term as I truly am enjoying it. I know my speed and stamina will increase over time as I stick with it. However, I think I have a lot to learn about running ""off the course"".

With that said, I want to know how you all prepare / recover from a run. What do you do to get ready, stretches, routines, mantras, etc. What do you do after, stretching, yoga, food, etc. What can I do to in my off time to make me a better runner? What's the best media to consume to learn and explore running?

I've packed on a disgusting 20kg since we first locked down in March of last year due to struggles with mental health and have been feeling horrible because of that, but the most I could manage to drag myself out to do was a little walking and some very half-arsed attempts to restart C25K.

We have been running the program Mon-Wed-Fri, and while there were many I was having to convince myself to finish, I had not shortened a single workout until this morning.

I was rotating the tires on my daughter's vehicle Sunday, and pulled a muscle in my back snatching a wheel up from a rolling stool (wise enough to know I shouldn't have done that but to my credit, this was the 4th wheel and had done the other three the same way).  I couldn't even sit down it hurt so bad.  I had to walk my daughter through finishing this and her oil change.  I was worried all yesterday, that I would miss my run today.  I woke up and considered running, as it didn't really hurt me any more to walk, but after the long runs my core has been sore a few times, so I ultimately decided not to tempt it.

Now what?  If I can run Wednesday morn, should I just skip day 1?  Should I just try to catch up on run 3 on the weekend?  There is also a chance I still won't be able to run Wed. since it is still hurting pretty bad.  If I take the week off, should I redo Week 6 before trying week 7?

48,"W1D1: It ain't a lot, but I'm going for it kings.","Hi Everyone!  


I'm new here, I was recommended this Reddit by some other ones, and I hope to give you guys weekly updates on my progress.  


Well, today I finally got into the sport life again, I went to the gym properly for the first time in months, and one of the few times in the past 2 years. Well, I really just want to get fit again so I can do fun active things whenever I want to, and not feel like a potato all the time. I tried to run a bit last time, but I was exhausted after running 6 seconds at max speed which just felt really bad to me, but it's good to know how long I can keep that up now. So I started running a bit, slowly walking the first 4 minutes, after which I ran at 10KM/H for 3 minutes, which almost killed me, 20 more seconds would probably have me needing too much air and collapsing. I walked for 3 more minutes, after which I ran 2 more minutes. In total, I did about 1 KM today, not all of it is running ofcourse but I'm happy, this is my first time actually properly running in 2 years, and I hope that that inactivity won't happen again and I can get back into all of this fully. I intend to keep doing this same running for a bit, and slowly just improve speed/length.  


**For my first week, I wanted to give my backstory to you all, so if you're interested you can keep reading, otherwise, I'll see you next week.**  
So, the past 2 years have been extremely tough for me, not even because of Corona. I come from a rather troublesome household and have only recently been getting into adulthood, my dad wasn't  around since I was 5, and my mother was alcoholic, my sister left the house when I was like 11, and my brother wasn't someone to look up to (He was just not real adult/role model back then), I really didn't have any parenting in my life and well, I like to see my as a self made man in terms of my personality. Because of well, this rather troublesome childhood I didn't really have any friends over because I was scared my mother would be drunk whenever they'd come home, leading to me really not associating with a lot of people, I had 1 best friend since I was 5 who I still know to this day luckily.   
Regardless, I didn't do any real sports up until I was 14, after which I joined the gym. I was really not fit at all back then, but I started doing a lot of cardio, and after some time, I managed to run 5 KM in 22 minutes, which I was very proud of. But well, around that time my home situation got worse, and I was basically ""traumatised"" and didn't really want to leave home much after school in fear of what I'd miss.  
So, years go by, and late 2019 my dad passes away, this hit me very hard because all dreams of rekindling stuff or fixing family were kinda shattered, and the idea of having one true parent in my life was a lot more unlikely. Corona hit later, and I became very lonely, I did have friends in school but we just didn't do any together, outside of school it was all me. I sat at home a lot, following school at home and well, turning older I ofcourse stopped growing, so eating extra took a toll on me, right now I'm not fat, just a little overweight but I'm not upset about any of that.  But to spare you all the details, after some time goes by, about 3 months ago I just started getting over stuff, I learnt not to feel guilty about things beyond my control, and wanted to live the way I wanted to live, my sadness or feelings started fading away, I stopped caring about what other people think and lived my on life, no insecurities no feelings no stress, all me.  
So, few months ago the gyms open again, I go with a friend but we only went a couple times a month,  but I just made up my mind last month, it's time for me to move on and become the person I really wanted to be, and just achieve what I want to have, an happy life. I now just go to the gym alone unless this friend asks me, which never happens, so I can just be there at peace with my thoughts. There's a lot of other things I need to get in check but all is coming together, my motivation for stuff is increasing, I'm fixing old friendships and building strong bonds with those people again, and if I become fit again, I can finally start lifting again without being tired after my first set. It's really all okay now and I get to live again, but before I can do a lot of physical stuff again and meet people again, do things again, make decisions and get stuff done, I need to have the mental right first. Now if I can become fit again, I can do anything, and if my first day can start with 1 KM, I am capable of anything. Once that is done, I'll be able to live how I want to, and I intend to keep you guys updated on this adventure. Hope to have your support through this kings and queens!

55,W6D3: VANQUISHED!,"I decided to start getting active last month. I have been sedentary while working from home during the pandemic (and way out of shape much longer than that tbh, let's be real here), and now that our apartment building's fitness centre is reopened I've been scheduling regular treadmill sessions!

I started W1D1 using the Get Running app on Aug 14, and spent the first few weeks ramping up my activity by speedwalking the run intervals then slowing to a slightly less fast walk, and then something flipped in my brain on W4D1 and said ""try speeding up"". I sped up to a VERY slow jog, and I plowed through and crushed it! I've been slow-jogging the run intervals ever since, increasing the speed in tiny increments if I feel able, and it's SO DANG HARD! I'm pouring sweat by the time I'm done, but I feel terrific afterwards!

Today I finished W6D3 at a slightly faster pace than D2. I spent the entire first 10 minutes thinking ""I'm going to have to slow down to finish this, I'm never going to be able to keep this pace up"", and just concentrated on staying in cadence with the beat of the song playing...before I realized it, I had less than 10 minutes left to go and was like ""hey, I really CAN do this!"" 

On a very silly personal side note, I feel like Daft Punk's ""Alive 2007"" album is probably THE best running soundtrack ever created.

So now I'm done with my break. I can't do much more right now than walk a mile or two, but much to my genuine surprise, I'm actually doing it. Four times so far, which doubles the number of times I've deliberately exercised in the last 5 years.

Week 1 was a breeze, loved it. I usually stretch for 5 minutes at my house and then walk to my apartments gym to use the treadmill, but week 2 day 1 I forgot to stretch at home and there was a bunch of people in the usually empty gym so I didn't stretch. I think this was a big mistake, even during the 5 minute warm up walk I noticed my legs feelings weird. 

My left leg was hurting quite a bit, mostly my knee and the top of my thigh. My right knee was hurting a little too, but it was mostly my left. I completed the workout but it was painful (I know I know, I shouldn't have done that). I went home and iced my left leg. 

Yesterday (rest day) I took it easy and iced my leg again. It was feeling a bit better. Today is week 2 day 2 and I decided to try though I still had a little bit of knee pain in both knees, the thighs felt better. I immediately could tell I wasn't ready, I did 2/6 running portions and then decided I needed to stop so whatever is going on can heal. Both my knees and tops of my thighs are hurting, especially the left leg. 

I'm icing and elevating right now, does this just sound like a sprain and I need to pause for it to heal up or am I doing something terribly wrong that's causing this? I'm so disappointed because my lungs feel great, way better then I imagined, but as soon as I really get into it I have leg pain lol 

For more info, I'm at a healthy BMI, haven't had any issues with my legs before and am just trying to get into running for fitness and endurance, not to lose weight.

72,Knee support curiosity,"Hi guys.

Glad to see a supportive community like this, nothing like a bunch of internet strangers motivating each other towards the same goal.

I have a question to ask. I've went to a physiotherapist about a month ago to have my knee checked out as I sort of twisted or over rotated it last year and it left a discomfort that comes and goes. After getting it checked, the physiotherapist said luckily it wasn't anything too bad and I could resume physical activities with a couple of precautionaries in mind.

The obvious being properly stretch/warm up before an activity, he also recommended using a knee support sleeve at the affected knee as well.

Now, I'm not sure if it's just a placebo effect or the thing really works, I don't get that soreness like I used to before. And this also got me thinking, should I wear one on the other knee as well as a precaution? As a note, the other knee is completely fine with no issues.

I'm M/30yo/167cm/67kg

I just wanted to pop by and say hi, and encourage everyone to keep going! I just ran my second half marathon on Sunday and am 10 weeks away from my first marathon. 

It was very slow going at first, and I remember that first 20 minute run. Ugh. I'm still very slow, especially with the heat and humidity, but I'm doing it and going the distance. My first half was at a 12:25/mi pace, and the one on Sunday was about 13:30/mi, but it was 20 degrees hotter. I don't have any time goals for the marathon, just to finish, but I fully expect to take around 6 hours. 

I'm sure you've heard it before, but slow down. I plateaued at 3 miles for a while when it started to get hot, and only when I slowed waaaaay down did it get easier. The idea that your slow pace should be a conversational pace is accurate. If you can't get out a few sentences, you're pushing too hard. Taking shorter strides and keeping the cadence up helped a lot (I use a 160-170 bpm playlist for this) . It might feel awkward at first but it makes a big difference. 

Finally, if you feel like you're getting dizzy when you're running, please see a doctor. For a very long time I thought I was just out of shape, but it turned out it was my heart.",C25K,1631200253,astroemma,3,1,True,2021-09-09

Not enough to make me have to sit down and catch my breath (except for when I went to Whitby), but enough to make me feel like I'm not getting enough air and taking a minute while walking to catch my breath. 

I've got other health concerns too but my GPs have consistently been dismissive of me. So I guess I got to take matters into my own hands now. 

30 year old male smoker who is struggling to quit. 

Anyway due to all of the above I'm far too self conscious and anxious to begin this journey outside. I'm especially concerned about running up any hills given my struggles when walking. And there is no way I could go to a gym with super fit people either, that's even more scary. (someone should make a gym solely for people with high bmis).

And I'm also too poor for a treadmill lol.

But... I have to start somewhere even if it's not the best conditions. 

So today I began my journey in my small 2 bedroom ground floor apartment. Of course staying in side so the neighbours don't see. 

And... Well I completed it and didn't feel I had to stop at any point. I guess due to being in a small flat and constantly having to turn back on myself maybe stopped me from going full throttle or walking as briskly as others. But we all have to start somewhere and maybe after a week or two I will be confident enough to do it outside. 

I also did the 12 minute stretch video at the end too which tbh I found made me sweat quite a bit too, so felt like another mini workout.

My original post is here which provides some context - https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/pl3z7i/w1d1_not_the_best_conditions_but_a_start/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


So tonight I didn't intend to run at all because I know I need to give my body some rest to recover especially as I'm just starting out.

However I took the dog for a walk this evening and felt the urge to attempt to run a bit. I didn't have any phone or watch on me. It was quite dark. My dog was obviously with me and I had a coat and some slim fit jeans on. 

I seem to have a trend here of running in non perfect conditions lol. 

Anyway let me begin and say I didn't complete the run but I never intended to either as this was spontaneous. I know this subreddit is about C25K but it helps me to keep a diary of my progress and that's what I'm doing.

To the run..

Was walking the dog in the dark and felt compelled to try and run a bit. I wanted to just test myself outdoors and see how i would get on. 

I began walking the dog from the house and reached an area of greenery which has a very slight incline after around 5 minutes. When I got there nobody was about so I just decided to run. 

With no watch or phone it was very much ""one Mississippi... Two Mississippi"" in my head. I ran round a small green field in a circuit. 

I only did 3 sprints in the end because somebody else came into the field at that point with their dog off the lead. And I was a bit self conscious and also worried about my own dog. In addition my coat was sticking to my arms with the sweat lol. 

One positive thing is that I felt from a breathing pint of view that while it was hard, that I could of kept going. However my left calf was definitely feeling the pain and it's still a bit sore now. I think this is obviously due to muscle weakness and the fact that my last (and first) run was only 24 hours earlier. 

Once the person keep into the field I then just continued my usual walk and went back home. 

Anyway this has given me some confidence at least. I think with some shorts or tracksuit bottoms, no coat, a time keeping device and music that I can certainly complete W1D1 outdoors if I was to try it again. Well providing I allow my muscles to rest and recover because my left calf is quite tight right now. Any tips for the tightness in the calf's, is there anything I can do to improve that? 

Sorry for the random post but I need to do this and keep a blog or IL not stick to the programme. I don't think il do this in 9 weeks and I'm cool with that. But I feel motivated to reach the end goal and as a competitive person I really hope IL get there eventually, it will be a huge achievement for me. I just need to stay focused, bite what I can chew, and don't push myself too far where I get injured as I need to keep this momentum. 

I don't expect replies or for anyone to read all of this. But writing is just a bit therapeutic for me and helps :)",C25K,1631304234,thehatchetmaneu,1,1,True,2021-09-10

36,An emo W6D3 playlist,"Let's talk about custom playlists by day. Ever customize for a specific day?

I happen to run to emo music because of who I am as a person. This fact came up in a comment section and someone asked what that looks like. Today being Saturday, and being that when I got up it was still a little chillier than I'd prefer, I wanted to procrastinate and had the time. So I built a playlist tailored to week 6, day 3. ""Coincidentally,"" it's the day I'm about to do.

Here are the goals:

1. The songs should be emo songs or emo adjacent.
2. At the start of the run, either ""Monsters"" or ""L.G. FUAD"" should play. The idea here is something of a [Blerch motivation.](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/running)
3. The end of the run should be A Praise Chorus. I find this song to be particularly motivating.
4. The warmup and cooldown portions should each be 5 minutes long.
5. The running portion should be 22 minutes long, since I am running week 6 day 3 today.

End result:

1. gnash - u only call me when it's raining out (2:14)
2. Amber Pacific - Save Me from Me (2:48)
3. Matchbook Romance - Monsters (4:04)
4. Taking Back Sunday - Cute Without the 'E' (Cut From The Team) (3:33)
5. Silverstein - Smile In Your Sleep (3:14)
6. Bayside - Devotion And Desire (3:30)
7. Paramore - Misery Business (3:32)
8. Jimmy Eat World, Davey Vonbohlen - A Praise Chorus (4:04)
9. KennyHoopla, Travis Barker - estella// (1:59)
10. All Time Low - Coffee Shop Soundtrack (3:01)

Warmup: 5:02  
Running: 21:57  
Cooldown: 5:00  
Total time: 31:59

You start running when Monsters starts, and stop when A Praise Chorus ends. Once you hear them singing about Crimson and Clover, you're super almost there. 1:42 to go. You're already past how long you'd run a week ago on that famous day.

[Here's a Spotify link to it.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Fr1svDRdK2ornWmsoE4qs?si=8eb5e78bc8264411) I do not currently have any plans to create any playlists this absurd for other days.

Anyways, I downloaded a C25k app, and have been doing the runs about every other day or every two days. On days when I don't run I bike (light ride, like 20 min bike ride to my job) or do some yoga (beginner's yoga, 10-15 mins on youtube). Some days I don't do anything at all but I am active like at least 5 days a week.

I work as a cashier at a grocery store and well.. stand all day. I've always had foot pain since working as a checker but now my calves have been hurting too, like a tender pain towards the front of my calves whenever I bend down. I have to stop bending down after a few seconds when I'm feel extra sore. I took a couple days off and did pretty much nothing but my legs still feel rather tender and achy. I also have like a constant soreness. I did buy new shoes about a week ago (cushy Asics).

62,Retraining - success!,"Just wanted to share with anyone who has done the program but then taken a significant amount of time off. I first completed C25K in January 2020. I went on to do two 10Ks (virtual/on my own, of course) in late March 2020 and again in November 2020. Throughout the year I did a bunch of 5K runs, with my fastest time on Strava being 30:37. 

Then in December 2020, I sprained my ankle (from too long of a WALK, believe it or not...) I was able to run on it a few times and then a longer run made me realize I had to take a break. The combination of the ankle not being 100%, the winter weather, etc, meant that I didn't even try running again until June, when I tried a few week 4/5 interval runs. And then I had to stop again because it's too hot for me to run in the summer where I live. 

**Effectively, I took 8 months off of running.** But then my first in-person 5K (one that had been postponed from March 2020) was finally happening on Sept 12 and I knew I wanted to run the whole course. So I picked up training again on August 29 with week 6, day 1 (5 min/8 min/5 min). I did that again, then moved on to two 10 min/10 min runs, then to 20 min, then 25. **On race day, I ran the full 5k, without stopping, in 36:24!** 

It feels so amazing that this is a skill I have now, and that with a bit of patience/careful training I can pretty quickly get back into it even after so much time off.

83,Learning my limits,"I haven't been posting much since I graduated, but rest assured, I have been consistently running 40-50 minutes every other day, with nothing particularly notable. Until today.


I went for a hilly run on Monday, it was quite exhausting, but a good work out. Then the dance school that I regularly attended up until they were forced to close in March 2020 (due to the covid-19 pandemic) was finally allowed to reopen, and yesterday was their inaugural adult class in their new space. So, being a long time supporter of the school, I signed up for one of the classes (jazz), and proceeded to dance my heart out. Pas de bourree, aggressive toe pointing, turns, leaps and some serious stretching. My body moved in ways it hasn't since March 2020. And While I'd like to pretend that I haven't got a pandemic bod, and that I can return to the same fitness level I was before the pandemic, I really can't. But I could pretend, and pretend I did. And while running for the past 4 months has improved my endurance, I haven't been working all of my dancer muscles. Until yesterday. 


And I woke up this morning, stiff and sore. Even after taking a bath in Epsom salts last night. Early this morning, unable to move my ankles, knees or waist, I Frankenstein's monstered my way to the bathroom, got changed, and as my muscles began to awaken from their slumber, I decided, yes, I think I will go for a run this morning. I'll take it easy, I'll do a bit of a shorter run on a relatively flat course around the neighborhood. And away I went. And I started off easy with a brisk walk for 5 minutes, and I felt fine. Then I started to run, and almost immediately, there was protest. My shins, my lower calves, my lower back, my forearm. All of them protesting the exertion. I told them, just get to the corner at the end of the street. By then, I will have been running for 3 minutes, and usually minute 2 is my breakthrough. If I can get past 2:59, I can run for 50 minutes straight. But 2:01 to 2:59 still tests my resolve, every time. So I struggled, I focused on my breathing and tried to ignore the pain in my legs, back and arm. But the pain got worse, and worse, and my muscles were starting to get stiff and the pain was not the good ""oxygen and blood moving to the muscles"" type of light pain. It was searing, burning metal applied to my extremities pain. It was ""I'm going to hurt myself if I don't stop"", pain. It was muscles seizing up to prevent injury type pain. And so I stopped. At 3:07 into my run. And I got some croissants and walked home.


Moral of the story, my dance class counts as one of my ""runs"" for the week, and needs a day of recovery before resuming activity. I don't know why I forgot this, I used to always schedule dance classes with a day of recovery in between. I can do two dance classes in a row, but I can't do two days of dance in a row. So today I will give my muscles a well deserved break, and work them tomorrow!

Given how well the 20 minute run went last week, I was surprised how much I did *not* want to do this run today. Didn't help that I am back running on hard neighborhood streets. 

What *does* help me is having this clear, specific program that tells me exactly what I'm supposed to do when, with no, ""Well, maybe today I'll just..."" dithering and bargaining and generally finding excuses. Just Do this now--whine if you like, but get it done, because that's what's on the program for today.

And I got it done. As always the hardest part is in the beginning. Once I was loosened up--and especially past the halfway point--I knew I was good. But it is starting to sink in that the reason I'm doing this is not to finish a 9 week program, but to *keep on* doing it for a long time to come. And it's honestly kind of messing with my head a little bit now. Going from ""almost done!"" to ""it will never end!"" kills the enthusiasm a tad.

87,W1D2 - Outdoors - I f**king did it,"Don't read no further if you don't like foul language.

So firstly to begin:

- No phone or time keeping devices
- Spontaneous run when walking the dog


The run: 

- Got to the little green near me and it was raining and nobody about so just went for it
- At sprint 3 my legs were hurting but I pushed myself 
- At sprint 6 I was in agony
- Fuck your brisk walks. Slow and steady wins the race lol.
- I was so close to giving up so many times especially after number 7 but being so close I had to do it even if I injured myself. I needed to complete this. 


Things I learned:

- I can see the word ""Mississippi"" must quicker in my head walking compared to win running. 
- A jog for me is about the same speed as a very brisk walk for a Yorkshire terrier lol. 
- My calf's kill and at this rate I can't do 3 a week but that's fine. Slow and steady wins the race and il get there eventually. 
- Was I running for a minute at a time? I don't know as I was counting in my head but that's cool with me. I'm still running and tbh not being anal about times suits me right now. 
- You feel the pain more walking than running. 
- Time seems to go by quicker running compared to walking but maybe that's because I was probably counting quicker haha. 


I tried to put in my route on one of those distance calculators including the 5 min walks and it was around 2 miles. But I suspect the walk back was longer than 5 mins, it was a real struggle. And for the running/walking part it was around 1.25 miles. Again though these aren't completely accurate but rough estimates. 

I don't know when my next run will be. I've no intentions of completing this in 9 weeks, my only goal is to reach 5k in jogging at some stage which I hopefully will.

9,How I Cured My Shin Splints,"I‚Äôll keep this short and to the point: I experienced the worst shin splints I ever had in my life around weeks 2-4.  (I hadn‚Äôt run like this in years.)


I used special shoes fit for my feet, compression sleeves and socks, heat, ice, stretching, swimming, foam roller, massage stick roller, walking; most of the common items.


However, I didn‚Äôt get full improvement until I started slowing down my runs.  At first I was every other day.  Then as the pain worsened and I kept failing, it became a few days in between.  Until I took an entire week off.  Then started back slowly.  I had a solid run after a week off, so I waited 4 days to run again.  


No pain!  So I took a rest day and ran again.  I ran further, and faster‚Äîwith no pain!


I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it would go away, but it did: with time off.


Although all of the tools and tricks helped mitigate pain, nothing cured it until I took time off and had more rest.


Gotta remember the app helps you incrementally do better by running more; but it‚Äôs not in stone.  Do more when you can, do less when you need to.


If you‚Äôre really coming off of the couch like I was‚Ä¶ take your time! 


It‚Äôs a marathon, not a sprint!  


I know the last thing you want to do is slow down or take a break, but it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs part of the process and can lead to you becoming a better runner.",C25K,1630335103,Safety_Suddden,3,1,True,2021-08-30

Basically I'm 18m and 210lbs, have not been active since middle school gym class basically haha.

Giving couch to 5k a go (I'm on week 1) and I am having to end some of my runs early because my shins are going crazy. This is totally not what I expected and I assumed any issues would arise from running out of breath (this hasn't been an issue though.)

I'm not sure if it's my technique that's wrong but I typically end my run 5 minutes early because my shins are killing me. I usually wait 20 minutes then squeeze out the last bit of the workout.

35,Restarting my running Journey - need some input,"Hi all, 
A little back story breakdown:

1.)got into running completely on my own 3 years ago, never had a proper training schedule but pushed myself to two, self recorded, half marathons. After the second I injured my knee, believe it to be muscular so I stopped running.

2.) about a year and a half ago I started road biking and it drastically improved my knee to the point that it is relatively fine now. Completed my first century ride about 6 months in. Still in decent biking shape.

3.) FAST FORWARD to the last 6 months. I have sporadically ran 1-2 miles at about a 9:30-10:30 pace on average of 1-2 days per week. 

So 3 weeks ago I decided to see if my knee would hold up to run a 5K.. it did with little to no fuss. I‚Äôm about 210lbs at 6‚Äô1‚Äù and 27 years old.. and am just destroyed at the end of the 5Ks, my feet start to go numb the last half mile or so but my body has been less sore overall, after each run. My question is am I pushing too hard and risking injury or will my body cave and adjust, what should I do next? I have ran 6 5Ks with at least two days of rest between each over the last 3 weeks and don‚Äôt know if I should keep doing this or need to increase frequency or what?

39,20-year streak of daily exercise!,"I am hoping that my story will help anyone out there who is struggling with the motivation to make positive changes to their health.  If you are having a hard time getting started on your C25K, my story may help‚Ä¶

Throughout my life, I (51/M) have struggled with being overweight.  I read lots of books, listened to a lot of doctors and other experts, and tried many, many diets.  Finally, I concluded that the simplest concept of ‚Äúeat less, do more‚Äù would be my best bet.  Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt that easy.  I spent many years struggling with maintaining consistent exercise, so I finally decided to apply my knowledge of psychology to my problem.

Neuropsychologists call it ""activity-dependent plasticity"", and I call it the **Power of the Streak**. I decided to exercise continuously for one hour per day, every day. Taking the advice of Covert Bailey, author of the best-selling book ""Fit or Fat,"" I focused on that time frame, rather than intensity. Bailey famously stated ""When you are just starting out, go so slowly that people will feel sorry for you.""  I imagined people looking at me, huffing and puffing down the street, thinking, ‚ÄúOh my, that poor man. Bless his heart,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúWow, that fat guy looks like he‚Äôs about to collapse.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt care.  It didn‚Äôt matter how fast I went, or how far, as long as I did it for an hour, and I did it **EVERY DAY**.

The day I decided to start my exercise streak was September 1st, 2001. Today, I hit the **20-YEAR** mark on my streak!  That‚Äôs **7306 days**!  I hope that everyone who reads this finds it useful to help them get started on a C25K!  Take care of the streak, and it will take care of you!",C25K,1630506192,Nikotheis,12,1,True,2021-09-01

I was getting really, really frustrated with feeling like I would never move on, just feeling super stuck. I ended up browsing numerous subreddits to find any tips to make it easier and actually listened to the tips for once. 

* I got new shoes, fitted at a local store!
* I started drinking more water overall, which is something I massively struggle with.
* I got a warm-up routine from one of my friends who's been running for years upon years
* annnnd I think the most important one was that I finally invested in a foam roller!

My biggest problem with W3 was that I would feel like my calves were impossibly tense and tight and I could barely complete the days, usually pausing to extend one of the walk cycles by 1-2 minutes because I just couldn't keep going. 

So, today, I stretched, used the roller, drank a cup of water before I left my house, and **I did it! :D** 

I completed W4D1 with actually no problems at all! It was easier than all my W3 attempts, weirdly enough!

The rain was coming down hard, but rather than being a hindrance, it was strangely cathartic. It was just me pounding the pavement in the park. The pitter-patter of the rain around me, the singing of the crickets, the tap-tap-tap of my shoes as I pressed onwards... The river rushed alongside me and I breathed with the wind in my lungs.

I had no goal other than to run along the river from end to end, so that's what I did. I ran down the river then back up the other side and then I was feeling good so I went a little more until I hit a red light and took that as a sign to stop, so I did.

It turns out up and down the river is 4.79 km and going to the red light is another 300 meters. It was the first time I'd run 5k and it was the best run I've ever had.

72,Nearly finished c25K - can I move to less running?,"A bit of background. I am in the UK. I have always cycled, I have gone a long way but not very fast.  I decided to change up my training and moved to Maffetone training, in the hope I could improve my aerobic threshold, that was in January 2020 then the lockdown came.  So I started walking, I have walked for miles.  The Maffetone training worked I began to find it really difficult to keep my heart rate in the range 10 bpm below my maximium aerobic heart rate.  The logical next step would be to start running.  As I was really worried about being able to manage running, I found a 16 week C25K.

Well I have surprised myself yesterday I finished week 16, run 3.  A 10 minute walk to warm up, 15 minutes running, 30 second walk, 15 minutes running and 5 minute walk to finish.

I am adding on an extra week and then I will be finished.  I have had a look with Google about what to do next.  I don't want to do more, in fact I want to do less.  I would like to get faster.  I have been starting my running from 6 to 7 am in the mornings. Of course the days are getting colder and shorter and I don't want to run in the dark.

So my question is how about I run one evening a week, Wednesdays are looking good and do a Parkrun on a Saturday morning?  Or is there no benefit to running twice?  So just do a Parkrun on a Saturday morning?  I am thinking about upping my cadence gradually to make me go faster. 

When the cold weather really sets in, I will probably stop or only do the Parkrun.  My question is will I then have to start all over again next spring?  Thank you for your responses in advance.",C25K,1630748787,Delicious-Stand501,4,1,True,2021-09-04

I just started C25K because I've never been a runner but would like to start. One of the things that's always put me off running in the past is that my TA (both, but mainly left) give me pain while doing it. 

I've ruled out shin splints - the pain is definitely the front/outside of the muscle, nowhere near the bone. 

W1D1 wasn't too bad - I ran on grass around a footy field. Pain in TA and associated tendon, but not too bad.   
W1D2, agony in TA and tendon, around all-weather running track. But the pain only seemed to continue while I was exercising, it cleared up soon after on the drive home.

However‚Ä¶ I realised a little part of me wanted the doctor to exclaim, ‚ÄúThis is incredible! Whatever you have been doing keep doing it!‚Äù

This little part of me dreamed that my disability metrics would improve which they just‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt. I have a little leeway to get better but certain things just can‚Äôt change. 
I realise this is ridiculous. Half an hour 3times a week will not make a difference, it‚Äôs more about building a habit and a mindset.
I know this. Some of my brain doesn‚Äôt. Why?‚Äô

Also‚Ä¶ my weight stayed exactly the same. This makes sense of course because a run only burns the calories of a snack and my clothes fit the same.

I have had an unhealthy relationship with food in the past and promised myself a couple of years ago I would 

a) never weigh myself again and if I had to, to never depend my worth as a person on the number on a scale 

b) never diet ever again, including ‚Äúhealthy diets‚Äù 

c) eat when I am hungry, stop when I am full

d) not beat myself up if I indulged a little such as eating that second slice of cake

Ever since than I have been sooo much healthier and sooooo much happier.

Why am I upset by not losing weight then? 
I started this program for myself and I think I noticed little changes in my mental and physical health such as walking to the bus stop without dreading it. 
Why am I upset I am not healthier as I already am?
I will never not be disabled and I have excepted there are certain thing‚Äôs I will never be able to do. Why am I disappointed then?

Ever since this doctor‚Äôs appointment it has been hard to motivate myself because there is this little voice in my head that tells me not to bother because it changes nothing anyway.

I do not want to listen to that voice because I didn‚Äôt start this program for ‚Äúmagical changes‚Äù but to get a little more endurance and improve my overall health.

I feel shitty right now. Shitty about whining and shitty for not ignoring it and just keep going.

Has anybody any advice?

A couple years later I tried again. Same result. A few weeks of improvement, then suddenly it just became impossible so I stopped.

Seems like that's been the pattern every couple of years ... I have YET to run a 5K!

I'm doing it again, and I think I've figured out the problem. It's pretty obvious, actually. 

Every single run is a gradual increase in distance. You repeat everything several times until you're ready to ""graduate"" to the next step.

All that goes out the window Week 5, Day 2. 

On Week 5, Day 1 I'm barely able to run three five-minute segments. If there are hills I can't do it at all.

But instead of repeating it three times (giving you the chance to master this already-difficult stage), Week Two, Day Two suddenly jumps to an 8-minute run!!

That is INSANE!

I am pretty sure this is the point where I gave up every single other time. 


This time, I'm going to do Week 5, Day One over and over and over until I can do it consistently, with or without hills.

THEN I'll move on to the next step. 

Not sure why it's not done like this in the app/program ... Seems like it would be a lot more in keeping with the gradual/ramp-up nature of the rest of the program.

With my other workouts (mostly HIIT) I would never be tired, would wake up before my alarm went off in the morning, etc. Now after running I am struggling to get out of bed the morning after, hitting the snooze and am generally lethargic the day afterward. 

Anyone else deal with this? Maybe my body just needs to get used to the extra strain of running?

71,Trust the program,"I graduated from C25K on Sunday. When I was nearing the end of the program, I was proud of myself and really enjoying the program, but I thought to myself, no way is it going to get me to 5k by the end. I knew my pace (slow) and I knew that the last run was 30 mins, so I figured it would take me another week or two after graduating to get me to a real 5k. My graduation run was 4.58 km including 5 min warmup and cooldown walks. 

This morning, I went on my first post-C25K run. I set Strava to notify me every 1/2 km and set a loose goal to run 4.5 km today. At the 4.5 km mark, I realized I was kind of feeling myself‚Ä¶ so I just went ahead and finished the 5k! And I didn‚Äôt even have to push myself past my limits or anything!

So in conclusion, this program rocks and it absolutely changed my life. For those of you still working your way through, stick with it!

Quick note on my route. I run around the block where I live, a 1.1km loop mostly slight downhill with a 200m uphill section right in front of my house.

First 90sec run felt great! Second 90sec was on the uphill and by the end I was struggling.

So far I've only tracked time, but I'm interested in knowing my distance (my goal is a 5k after all).

Thing is, I don't like to know my calories burned because it sends me into this toxic mindset of ""earning"" food and thinking about weight when I don't actually need to lose any. As a young woman I'm surrounded by my peers' restricted eating habits and fatphobic attitudes, so I try to avoid it if I can. I mainly focus on what my body's capable of, and how to fuel it effectively and nutritiously.

93,W5D3 was more of a mental hurdle than a physical one.,"TL;DR see Title. Don't let your imagination make you give up before you even try. 

Since starting the program, I have been more or less going out every other day for a run. I was motivated to run and I felt good every time afterwards, even despite the grueling pace or conditions. As I entered Week 5, though, I found myself reluctant to lace up and kept finding reasons to stay in.

*""It's pretty hot out and the humidity sucks""* ...Even though the weather was no different from every other day I've been running.

*""It's raining today, so I ought to stay in"" ...*Even though I had run in the pouring rain just a week before.

*""I'll be too tired for work""* ...Even though I always feel more alert after running, rather than tired. 

And so on. 

Normally it takes me 5 days to complete a Week; this time it took me 11 days because I had convinced myself that 20 minutes with no walk breaks was going to be a miserable experience. I dreaded Day 3. It was the midboss that I was afraid of losing to, so I didn't dare even try. I repeated Day 2 twice, telling myself it was to train up but really it was an excuse to put off Day 3 yet again.

Yesterday while I was sitting on the couch like a lump, I wondered if I should repeat Day 2 for the third time when it hit me: *Was I so intimidated by Day 3 that I wouldn't even attempt it?* 

When I play games, I *never* skip the challenges and optional bosses - in fact, I seek them out. Do I always win? Of course not. But the thrill of the fight, the begrudging defeat, and then the sweet taste of victory after a hard-fought battle always makes it worth it. I can replay a level a hundred times but I can't even try one 20 minute run even once? It was so laughable a notion that, despite the honestly very awful humidity and high temperature, I grabbed my gear and hit the pavement immediately. 

Whether or not I succeeded is not the point at all. I reached a milestone yesterday, which is to not balk at a challenge before attempting it.  The apprehension and dread I had before has disappeared; I'm once again eager to get out there and run.

I am currently a postdoc, working with a few research partners to study the effects and safety of certain compounds on natural EPO levels and, in turn, cardio performance (as measured by VO2 max). We've seen really positive, statistically significant results, and are considering spinning out some of this research, and bringing it to market in the form of a drink supplement designed to improve aerobic fitness in cardio athletes (a 'protein powder' for cardio, per se). We're interested in candid feedback on the potential viability of such a product, and to that end -- would be incredibly valuable if any of you could complete the following 2-3 minute survey. We're all pretty poor PHD candidates, so can't offer any compensation for completing the survey, other than our eternal gratitude :)

As I was lacing my shoes I remembered that the park wouldn't open for another hour so I changed my plans last minute and drove to the nature reserve by the sea. I chose a hiking trail that has signposts and just started my lesson there.

It was beautiful! It was so hard and it was something I never would have tried had I thought about it more beforehand.

Because I just chose the hiking trail with the right length (3km) I didn't think about anything else. And only found out when I was going that this trail was all off road, a lot of parts even were very deep sand. And then because I wast in the dunes it was A LOT of up and down.

But I did it! I made it the whole lesson. I went really slow due to all the sand and going up and down but I made it through! I am so proud of myself. I cannot believe I did this! 

When I got back to the car park, another runner came up to me to ask advice about the terrain, I was so suprised! I thought he actually thinks I am a runner! And then I thought, I AM!

48,"Week 9 Overview - Not ""graduating""","Hi folks! This is actually my first post in this community. It comes late, when I am at Week9. First of all, I run on treadmill for now and I followed this program:  
[https://www.treadmill.run/couch-to-5k-on-a-treadmill.html](https://www.treadmill.run/couch-to-5k-on-a-treadmill.html)

My experience with C25k is as follows: I started mid May, repeated Week 2 (I was running too fast), 4 (I was sick) and 6 (I had an important exam).

Reaching Week9 I was concerned about the difference in time between running 30min and running 5km: since I'm running quite slowly (7 km/h) the difference is 13 minutes! So I chose to run 3 times 30 minutes as last week and then reach 5km distance bit by bit. My idea is to link the C25k to Hal Higdon Novice 5k training, starting from Week5.  
[https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/5k-training/novice-5k/](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/5k-training/novice-5k/)  


This program lets you reach 5km step by step and I really feel more confortable doing it this way: after reaching 5k mileage I will start to include some speed training in my runs, so I want to run 5k with enough ease. I'm sharing this idea for everybody in doubt about how to bridge between the end of C25k and actually run 5km, it is here to try if you like it.

  
Final thoughts about the C25k:  
\-C25k community really boost your performance, thanks!  
\-It is great to recover Health and Fitness, I came from way too many years of sedentary life  
\-Waste/spend some repeats on Week1 and 2 in order to find your running speed

W1D3 COMPLETE!","I just finished W1D3 of C25K, which I've never made it past beginning of week 4 of over the...countless times I've tried it. I am so glad I found this community, as it is so positive and motivating! I'm hoping to check in here for some accountability and support, because I know \*how I get\*.

Probably every single time I've tried this program in the past, I've had god-awful shin splints, but as I'm using a treadmill this time, I've been pain-free. so that's a major win. It might be hard to believe that I was a competitive dancer of 10+ years and I have no problems squatting three digits and lifting weights and doing HIIT and don't feel like I am in that bad shape, but when I'm required to run a few minutes, my body is not the most.........cooperative. I'm telling myself that my heart just was never trained to do this specific endurance activity vs. quick burst activity ever in my life, and that it is something to learn!

I attribute my past failures to:

\- Running on dirt trails/rocky hiking paths because it had a nice vibe.

\- Running on inclines, because of the streets I seemed to pick.

\- Running on pavement/sidewalk.

\- Changing locations each run.

\- Too worn-in shoes/shin splints.

\- Running back to back with intense heavy weight leg workouts in-between, which I'm skipping now since my wrist has been acting up.

\- Mental competitiveness, comparing myself to my soccer player partner who would run 5,000 miles with one drop of sweat on the forehead, leaving me in the dust after 3 years off time, while I'm practically dryheaving (lol).

\- Desire to scream, cry, and say, ""I hate this"", ""I'm just not cut out for this form of exercise"", etc. Seriously. I get like ANGRY when I see how easy it is for him, and I just feel terrible about myself. I can't run next to him.

I decided that with the treadmill, I could pace myself more and I could do this program without comparing myself to anyone else but myself. I have a lot of anxiety going out on outdoor runs by myself (I have an anxiety disorder that I am being treated for; I am a LOT better than I was years back, so grateful!), but one day, I'd love to work on that confidence also. One thing at a time, I suppose.

I feel like I ""run"" really slow (I can run as slow as 2.5-3mph on the treadmill...maybe it's cuz I'm a 5'2 shrimpy), but I read some articles on here that it's the ""movement"" that counts and that I can work on speed later. Hard to internalize that sentiment, but I'm trying. My first workout, I needed a few minute break in the middle, but once I slowed it down, I didn't need one, which felt awesome. I also added an electrolyte drink to sip on a bit, and that's helped immensely. I'm already getting anticipatory anxiety of week 3-4, but I'm just going to try to take it one day at a time.

I am so proud of all of you who have kicked C25K's proverbial butt and surpassed your own expectations. The fact that you share your stories helps so many people, you probably have no idea the impact your experiences have on others! I personally thank you for giving me hope in myself that I can do this.

If the stars align, I'll be back next week to celebrate another week's completion!

Good luck to all of you on your running journey, whether you can run for 5 seconds or 5 miles! You've got a cheerleader in me always.

59,W5D3: I did it! Ran a 5K without stopping.,"I've been following a C25K training plan only very loosely,  choosing instead to alternate running and walking intervals according to what's comfortable and moderately challenging for me.  I was a little apprehensive when I glanced at the plan this morning and saw that it was calling for running/jogging 25 minutes without walking, especially since I'd only done about 20 minutes at the most so far.  But I tried it!  And then I kept going for five minutes more and finished at 30:10; while it's not my all-time personal best, it's better than I've done in a good long while.

I confess that I did under optimal conditions: on a treadmill in the air-conditioned gym, no incline (normally I put it at at least 1.0, but today I wanted to finish).  I put it on 6.1 mph for about 28:45, then kicked it up to 8.0 for the last leg.  No breakfast or lunch beforehand, other than some coffee when I first woke up; I didn't want to run with either a full stomach or an empty one, so I had a spoonful of peanut butter beforehand as a compromise.  (Eating a late lunch of saag paneer now.)

My next goals are to lose 20 pounds so my joints don't have to bear so much stress and to cut 5 minutes off my 5k time in time for a December 4th race.",C25K,1628879119,merganzer,8,1,True,2021-08-13

64,Barely completed day 1 of week 4.,"Hi all! I'm new to the sub so apologies if this has been discussed already. 

Background: I'm an ex-dancer, 19 year old girl who used to love fitness/running until I quit dancing at 16 for unrelated reasons, but I went from 123 pounds to 176 and have remained at that number for 3 years. My family recently purchased a treadmill and it happens to have the C25K program in it, so I tried it out!

First three weeks were fine, of course sometimes it was very easy, other times it was very hard. I started week 4 today (3 mins walking, 5 mins running, repeat twice) and god I just couldn't do it entirely. 

I was fine up until the end of the first running segment, and I had to stand on my treadmill with one foot on each side to catch my breath. During the second running segment, I stopped again, let the timer go for a minute, then would run a minute, stop for a minute, and then ran the rest.

I know it's quite normal to have off days, but for some reason this was sucked a million times worse than the others! I'm VERY good at sticking out and pushing myself, but I just couldn't today. 

To all my C25K friends - what should I do? Obviously, shake it off and keep going, but I guess I'm kind of stuck as to how to not let this get to me and how to just keep going.",C25K,1628896381,emily-famlorenzo,3,1,True,2021-08-13

Left my running gear and shoes outside my bedroom door for easy access when I do w1d2 on Monday. 

Looking forward to running 5k again. It's been about seven years since I have and a long enough run always made me feel good.

80,Struggling with shin splits after a very long break and feeling discouraged,"Hi everyone üëãüèº 31F in the USA here. I am trying to get back into running and struggling with shin splints. I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight since I last ran but would like some input as I‚Äôve never had such awful pain from running, EVER.

Last summer i was 20lbs lighter when I started c25k. When I finished, I had lost about another 15lbs. I was running only from May through December. Since then, I have gained nearly 30lbs. I have tried to start running again several times since this past March, but have experienced too much pain.

Finally in the last two weeks I decided to commit to a very slow start as I really miss running. I underpronate and have very high arches, so I decided to invest in some Brooks Glycerin GTS 19 (got these after my first w1d1 as I couldn‚Äôt complete w1d2 due to the shin pain). I have now done w1d1 four times, and unable to complete it fully with the exception of the very first time.

Today I attempted w1d1 a 4th time, this time with knee high compression socks and even walking felt nearly unbearable after only one minute of running. The pain is like a burning/numbing and it prevents me from walking normally/comfortably.

I have been doing exercises at home to build up strength again (using the other Fitness22 workout apps). I feel like I am seeing no improvement, maybe even further deterioration. Any insight is greatly appreciated as I feel really discouraged.",C25K,1628990869,holyzzz,9,1,True,2021-08-14

And for my goals and needs, it worked! I went from 175 pounds (maybe a bit more. I don‚Äôt trust the scale I used to start off) to a current 158 pounds over the course of the program. I took an extra month total to complete the program because of being busy with work or school or too tired. But I stuck with it. Week 1 day 1, week 2 day 1, and week 5 day 3 were definitely the toughest parts of the program for me but to everybody out there, STICK WITH IT. It‚Äôs worth it! I have some more pounds I want to get rid of so I‚Äôm advancing to the 10K trainer.

89,Graduated C25K a few weeks ago -- my story thus far!,"Hi all; well of text incoming. Not even sure why I'm typing this all up, other than I feel it will be helpful for myself to write out a version of my journey so far; also, I know from my own experience, I have GREATLY benefitted from reading all of your experiences and advice (as a lurker), so who knows what someone else might find useful?  
  
I am a 30 year old male, started at 5'10 and 235 pounds. The last time I seriously ran was back in high school when I played football and weighed 160 pounds. Obviously, going so long without cardio and putting on so much weight and bodyfat made running HARD. But this program was amazing! It really is unbelievable how it starts you off running for 60 seconds and ends with 30 minutes.  
  
Now, I am still overweight. I have gotten down to 216. I'm hoping as it continues to drop to my initial goal weight of 199, running will become easier. And my pace is ABYSMAL. However, it really is true what everyone says here--don't worry about pace. Just focus on doing the runs. I will say, I never ""failed"" a run. This is thanks to just slowing my pace way down rather than stopping if I have to. I know a lot of healthy, fit people do sub-30 minute 5Ks. That is still just a pipe dream to me, and that is PERFECTLY FINE! Because I am up and running and moving and I feel great. I can already notice the health benefits for me.  
  
I have just started the Bridge to 10K program and finished the first week. Today, I decided to take a break from the program for 1 day jsut so I can go back to running continuosly (if you didn't know, the Bridge program has you go back to intervals for a bit to build up to 60 minutes of running).  
  
So today, I decided just to see if I could run for a 5K. I was one of those who did not reach a 5K when I finished the program. In fact,  earlier in the program I had mixed some walking with running to reach a 5k, and my personal best was 45 minutes. So, slow. But today, I was able to run without stopping for 36:45, making that my new personal best 5k! That is a time I am EXTREMELY proud of, even though I know a lot of people go faster! It took a lot of work to reach that, and I know based on how my body feels that that is a good ass workout for me, personally!  
  
I am doing lifting on my off days as well. Also, sometimes I need to take a day or two off from the program because I like to hike, and my legs need to recover after hiking.  
  
So, I've seen my stats improve as follows:  
  
--Weight: 235 to 216 pounds  
--Duration: 60 second runs to nearly 37 minute runs  
--Distance ran: I could do about .2 miles at the start and can now do 3.1  
5K Time: First attempt at 45:00, now 36:45  
Mile time (I run these occasionally to try to lower this as well): 14:00 to 10:19  
  
From the stats above, I have the hardest time lowering that mile time. I know it will come with increased endurance, speed, and weight loss, though. It's a tad depressing knowing that back in high school I could do 7 minutes, but I still feel great about what I'm doing.  
  
Let's see, I've been rambling...the last thing I'll end on is the #1 biggest thing I've noticed change about my running: my recovery has improved like crazy!!! When I first started, I'd be gasping for air for, it felt like, 10 minutes after a run. Now, a 60 second break makes me feel like I could keep running! My heartrate slows more quickly and my breathing gets under control super fast.  
  
And the hardest thing for me still: my legs and feet. I've been fitted for running shoes, but the limiting factor to my runs is my lower half! My feet get sore and my legs get still before my lungs give out.  
  
Okay, like I said, it just felt nice to type this out, and maybe someone will find something interesting to compare my info to theirs! Take care!",C25K,1629049822,Sharks_Are_Fintastic,4,1,True,2021-08-15

I was told the following analogy about runners (specifically for the Boston Marathon, but I think it could apply to any race). I am skeptical of the story but I'd like to do my due diligence.  I'm using my best Google-fu but still coming up short. I'm looking for stories similar to the analogy described below and any sources or communities you can point me to that might know more.

Here's the analogy:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You have trained for years to even qualify to run... you have come to Boston... you have started running the race..... and then you realize how hard running a marathon really is. So, at mile 16, you quit. You realize that quitting is so much easier than running and you start to rationalize that quitting was the smart thing to do. But there is a problem, your brother also prepared, came to Boston, and ran the race, and he did not quit. At first, you are ok with him running and finishing the race but quickly the guilt of being a quitter starts to eat away at you. You start to badmouth running and your brother in hopes of alleviating the guilt and now anger you feel towards running.  
&gt;  
&gt;Quickly you realize that your old group of friends, who are runners, are not going to buy into your badmouthing of running; so, you gravitate towards other ex-runners who also hate it. Soon you are in an echo chamber... you are all reassuring each other that you are right, you keep saying that running is evil, you all talk about how much easier it is to not go running, and only fools would run a marathon. But every time you see a runner it pricks your conscience and triggers guilt from \[not exercising\], shame from your lifestyle, and anger that they dare find joy in running.  
&gt;  
&gt;Soon it becomes your quest not just to not run, but to get other runners to quit running too. You start to blog, tweet, and Facebook about how awful running is, it becomes all-consuming. ...You feed off the running hate-fest of others. For each runner that you can convince to quit will provide you the momentary satisfaction that you are at least not alone in your misery. The longer this cycle continues the less you remember the joy of running with your brother and friends, till the only memories are jaded memories of everyone being rude, and how awful running felt.

I'm trying to find these poor former-runners who are consumed by hatred stemming from their own inadequacy to get their side of the story but despite how vocal they are described to be in this analogy, I'm having some trouble. 

I assume as runners yourselves, you are constantly assaulted by these kinds of people who have quit and seem to relentlessly attack your choice to run. Please share your stories.",C25K,1627754539,DevilaMayCare,3,1,True,2021-07-31
17,"Completely new to the sub, but a quick question:","I have once in a blue moon done a tiny bit of running. Yesterday I ran about a mile and a quarter because I was in a rush, but then what always happened happened, I hit a wall because I get stomach cramps and I also have asthma. I would like to get into running, but every time the stomach cramps and asthma get bad, and get even worse if I try and keep going so I always have to stop. For context, my fastest mile time was a couple of years ago at 7:45, and that really pushed me probably more than I should. Also for some context that was in fifth grade, I am now going into 8th. 

Also another thing, this may be a stupid question, but how do you people get up to doing something like a 10 mile run? Last Monday I did a twelve mile hike to earn an award, and that took about 4 hours, and was a huge achievement for me, though that was just walking.

The second one was great - all 25 minutes, and a better pace - ran about 2 miles. Both of these were indoors on a track. I had to take a week off for travel, and I tried to run the 3rd one yesterday outside on a reasonably flat route. Weather looked OK, with some mild sprinkles. About 6 minutes in it opened up and started pouring, so I sprinted about a half mile back to my car (turns out my sprint pace is about 8 min/mile right now). Got home, and shins and ankles are sore. Instead of resting, decided to go back out today and try again - and stopped after 6 minutes. My shins and heels were hurting, but not anything horrible - but my mental game was just gone. All I could think about was ""I have 19 more minutes of this, and I feel like crap"". So I walked for a couple of miles just so I could say I did something. I realize I was also a bit dehydrated, and hadn't eaten that much up to that point.

So now I'm going to pause until Thursday (I'm 48 - and take a while to heal) and try to wrap up W7. I also decided to switch shoes - from Brooks Dyad to Hoka Gaviota 3... I want to see if the additional cushion helps with my heel and shin issues.

A possible solution would be to ignore either the distance or timing, which in that case would I ignore timing or distance (walking 400m seems a bit too much tbh).

I've been icing and elevating the foot but I'm itching to get back out running  I've decided to do the c25k again once I start, just to ease myself back in and not push the ankle too much.

New here but started the program a week ago. I'm 43, not overweight but not fit either. I'm generally skinny but getting a middle aged man's gut which I want to keep under control.

I did the first day last Thursday and didn't find it too hard but definitely felt it in the middle. Second run on Saturday was a little easier, I definitely worked hard but it didn't feel hellish at any point.

Was going to go out again yesterday but it was absolutely lashing down all afternoon.

So I went out just now. It was a little warmer than other days but not by much. But I really, really struggled. For first run was fine but the others I was begging for the end to come! I'm sure my walk intervals were slower too.

But looking at my tracking stats my pace was 8'10"" compared to 9'55"" on Saturday, and I covered 3.43km compared to 2.92km.

So I guess I just pushed it a bit hard today.

I started on C25K back in January 2018 and shortly after found this sub, it was great to speak with others on the same journey, I can't remember exactly when I graduated but it wasn't a smooth path and there were repeat weeks.

I kept running after graduating and worked towards 10K in a freestyle fashion, so on etc.

Early 2019 an ITB issue took me back loads and I had to strengthen up to get back running, it was about 2 months to get back to 5K distances.

Anyway cut a long story short, I kept at it, but nothing crazy, I still only run three maybe four times a week but this weekend I completed the Round Reading Ultra Marathon (50K) and even pretty much in my target time.

I'm still no uber athlete, but this is here to show that you can get there, 5K maybe all the distance you want, but with the strength you have and the support of this community you got this.

Today I've finished W5D2, which was 8 mins jog, 5 mins walk then 8 mins jog again. I did it with little to no trouble, with a consistent pace of just under 7 minutes/km during the jogging parts. However, it doesn't matter that I can complete these runs with this pace, because I feel like I didn't have any big improvement during the last weeks, and this pace is not enough to finish 5K in 30mins (since that would require a pace of 6 min/km). 

I'm not saying this demotivates me because running is one of the best parts of my days, I'm just curious if anyone else had a similar experience nearing the last few weeks, where they didn't feel like they are improving quickly enough to be able to finish the end goal, 5 kilometers under 30 minutes?

If so, how did it turn out in the end?

6,W8D2 bust...sort of...,"I made it all the way to Week 8!  Day one went well, it was hot and humid, but I took it slow and made it home covering 2.76 miles in 38 minutes.  My run pace was 12:44/mile, which is pretty consistent with my other run-only days.  

Today, I thought it would be a good idea to work on speeding things up a bit.  I got some good news just prior to starting, so I was feeling amped.  A little less than halfway through my run, I could feel my body telling me to slow down.  Then my body was saying it was time to walk it.  This happened again about 2/3 in.  

By the time I got home and looked at my run tracker, I covered 2.74 miles with a  12:44/mile pace.  Moral of the story?  It's ok to stop and walk.  And it's ok to slow down.

14,W8D2...early graduation?,"First time posting here. Was doing W8D2 after work today. I'm following the NHS c25k program so w8 is 3 runs of 28 mins with a w9 with 3 runs of 30 mins. I had a bit of trouble running the 28 mins the first time, but today I hit 28 mins and still felt like I had some left in me and went another 2 minutes to reach 30. I hit a 28:01 minute 5k and at the 30 minute mark when I stopped, although I was pretty tired, I thought to myself ""I could've kept going"". 

When I started c25k 9 weeks ago (I repeated Week 2 because I struggled a lot in the beginning), I was out of breath after a minute of running and never thought I would ever make it this far, I was just gonna keep going until my asthma got the better of me. But after keeping with it (and learning to use my inhaler before my runs), I reached a 5k in under 30 mins! 

I'm still gonna finish out the rest of the runs before I consider myself ""graduated"", but super proud of myself for doing this. Never thought I would make it this far. Reading everybody else's posts as I went definitely helped motivate me to keep going.

26,W1D2... Splat.,"I'm a rank novice on my second-ever-in-my-life ""run.""  I put ""run"" in quotation marks because I am spending more time walking than running, but I'm doing exactly what my fictional coach from Zombies Run 5K tells me to do, so I'm feeling modestly proud of myself.

I can tell I'm doing better than I did on day 1.  What's more, it's starting to feel good.  A smile appears on my face that I didn't put there on purpose, and I can feel a happy warmth filling my brain.  ""This is why people run, isn't it?"" I think.  ""This feels really good!  I'm definitely going to come back for Day 3.  Good job, me!""

And then I trip.  And SPLAT.  Hard, right onto the pavement.  

I didn't even realize that was a risk.

28,Music to get you PUMPED,"So I‚Äôm on week 6 of couch to 5k and I completed run 2 today, which is a 5min warm up, 10min run, 3min walk, 10min run and 5min cool down, for those who aren‚Äôt familiar with this app. 

And I must say, I am SHOCKED that I did it and enjoyed it. I began this journey having restarted the app and I have pushed myself each week. Yes I‚Äôve had to skip running due to holiday/illness but I always pick up where I left off in the app. I thought today would be a hard run to overcome but as I was listening to the ‚ÄòBeyonc√© inspirations‚Äô playlist on Apple Music, Proud Mary by Tina Turner came on and BOY is this the song for running. 

I suddenly felt my worries ease away and I began to get PUMPED whilst running on my treadmill. I reduced my speed (5.0mph to 4.5mph) because I kept getting stitches and didn‚Äôt think I could make it through the program on long runs, but this song had me hyped through it all. 

I just wanted to share, in case this song helps others get over that mental and physical roadblock and to see if anyone else has some music recommendations for running. As a tip- I love rap and anything with a beat.

32,Finished W5D3! Struggling with pace... could need some advice.,"I did it! I finished W5D3! It was a hurdle I wouldn't ever think I could take but I just got out of bed spontaneously and decided to do the next step and it worked. 

Now that I completed it I don't feel really good about my accomplishment because of my pace. I'm at +14 min per mile and it seems horribly slow. I know it's the time that counts but I want to run the 5k and the app tracks the time... also I feel like I'm underperforming massively, I'd like to run something normal like 10 min/mil but it seems impossibly far away. I'm a ""healthy"" young person in their 20s and should be able to have normal performance no? 
After 10+ years of doing nothing at all (not even going for a walk) and only sitting at my desk all day I decided it's time to do something for health and running seemed like an easy way to lose a bit of weight/stay in shape. I started by running around the block which took me around 8 minutes once I managed the full lap without breaks. After that I looked into running apps and discovered c25k. I skipped a lot and started in w4d1 on July 1st. I always went with what's comfortable so I don't get a bad experience that would frustrate me to stop. I started  with w4d1 for a week to get used to it and comfy, then w4d2 the next and so on. In total from first day of trying to run around my block to w5d3 I spent about 15 running sessions, so I had bigger breaks in there when I was busy. I did lots of repeating especially of w5d1 to get used to running more regularly. Can't say I enjoy it, I find it terribly boring but I hope to get used to it as part of a routine so I don't bother and will accept it as something that simply has to be done a few times a week. 

Now for the pace I feel like I'm cheating because while the time matters it says run x distance but I can't. I'm slow af! Id never run 5km in under 40min! (Which is fine but it's c25k and not c230minofrunning so it feels like I'm betraying myself and only doing half the work). I try not to stress with it too much, I know/estimate my limits quite well and run slowly so I can power through a whole session following the program but I'm quite done at the end so it's not like I could do much more in regards of speed. I'm also slightly worried about injuries and heard slow running would prevent it so i guess at least that's something positive. So far I never had any pains or anything. I do see improvement in stamina but I feel like I just can't run faster if I want to finish the program. The longer I can run the slower I get! Any tips for that? 

I had a slight breakdown after seeing my w5d3 distance (only 1.5 out of 2 miles but I always skip the warm up walks at the beginning and the end so that bit of distance is lost but I don't consider it to be part of the actual running distance anyways) and instead of being happy about running for 20min I got quite frustrated and thought about restarting the whole c25k and trying to practice at the ""correct"" speed right away? Would that be a good idea? Or should I just run  until I do the 30min and then run the 30min every time and try to get more and more distance until I eventually hit 5k? 

Also how would running shoes improve the experience? I have no idea about those or what to get I just use converse and it seems fine. Im worried that for 30min of running I'd get even slower and if I go faster I won't last the whole session and it really makes me want to start from scratch, at the right speed.",C25K,1627025085,redtank494,11,1,True,2021-07-23

The entire process takes a couple minutes.

It beats putting on an album or shuffling because it's specific to your workout and you can think about how there's just one track or chorus left, rather than focusing on the remaining time or distance.

I wouldn't say I'm super disciplined with it--I work out in intervals for 20-30 minutes 4-5 times per week (while watching Jeopardy with my parents, lol).  But it really has helped, somehow.

Then, that Wednesday, I donated blood. I knew it would impact my progress and probably make it so I couldn‚Äôt do the 3rd week 5 run comfortably that week, but I figured I‚Äôd just repeat week 5 from the beginning to give myself a chance to recover and be able to get back on track by the next week. 

I was wrong. The first run post donation (w5d1 repeat) was hard, but I made it through. Then I tried to move on to day 2 and I had to stop halfway through because my heart rate was at 190 and I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I figured I needed to take it slower, so I gave myself more rest days and more permission to take walk breaks if needed. I kept trying to repeat W5D2, and after 4 post-donation attempts at it, I still can‚Äôt make it through even though it was almost effortless the first time I ran it. Today I ran W5D1 again so I could feel like I can accomplish something, and I did make it through a run for the first time in weeks, but it was just as hard as my first post donation run. 

I‚Äôm feeling so demoralized about this. I‚Äôve always donated blood and I think it‚Äôs important, but I‚Äôve never had a regular workout plan before and I didn‚Äôt realize how much it would affect me.

Background on me... Im a transwoman who for the 6 years of my transition, I have been locked indoors with no physical activity (until quite recently) and malnourished (in a not getting the right stuff... I mostly just ate chick fil a for 5 years, learned how to make spaghetti a year ago and thats my new main meal). So basically I am so out of shape and have a lack of muscle that I cant even do more than like 10 wall pushups without hurting. I am 5'6"" and weigh 180 so Im almost obese but Im not like... too much. Anyways... now for the present day.

I just started today, and for the past month I've been walking 5ks almost every day so I thought I was ready to start this honestly. But today I did my apps first day... 5 min warm up and cool down on either end and 7 pairs of 1 min runs and 1.5 min walks. LET ME TELL YOU.... I pushed hard and didnt give up but it got to a point where I could barely pick up my legs. Even though I finished, I lost my vision in the parking lot and almost passed out on the grass near my car (i was at a park). 
I remember in high school I ran a 6 min mile and was fine after so to be on the ground barely able to breathe or see makes me feel like I am in over my head.

I dont want to give up, but I dont want to injure myself or screw up my body or whatever from going beyond my limits... (plus ultra style (that was an anime joke))

Sometime over the last couple of months I became a runner :) 

I found week 6 the hardest. I had the momentum after W5D3, but I couldn't keep it going. So I went back to intervals and started to run 4 mins, walk 30 seconds for a while until I was ready to hit the long runs.

I am not fast. I did 5.5K tonight in just over 40 mins. But I did it! I went from not running to running for 40 minutes straight. 

If you are struggling, keep at it. It doesn't matter how fast you go, or how long it takes you. Just keep going. If you are debating on going for a run one day, just go, if you have a bad run, shake it off and try again next time. Any run is better than no run at all. 

I found a lot of motivation from this forum and seeing everyone's stories. I am going to keep at it. I am so proud of myself and I am so proud of all of you!!",C25K,1627351457,Pananger,3,1,True,2021-07-26
95,Would it be a bad idea to go back a few weeks to run at a faster pace?,"I've done week 1 to 4 at a 5mph pace. Then I ended up slowing down to 4.5mph in order to complete week 5, which includes the dreaded 20 minute run.  

The thing is that while it's easier, jogging and this slower pace feels kind of awkward. Ideally, I'd like to complete the this program at  6mph pace, which feels more like actually running. I actually tested myself the very first day I started, and I managed to run for 5 minutes straight at 6mph before feeling like needing to stop. I tested myself again today, and I did the same 5 minutes at 6mph before needing to stop. So I'm kind of disappointed that despite the progress at slower speeds,  my maximum time running at 6mph without breaks didn't really improve. 

So now I figure now I need to run a 6mph to actually get better at running at 6mph. My thinking is to go back to week 3 and do it at 6mph, which I think I could probably manage.   Is his  bad idea?

Similar to a lot of others, the upcoming Week 5 looks incredibly daunting, with 5 min jogs becoming standard, and a brutal 20 min jog on Day 3. 

I see a lot of advice on slowing down pace to succeed - I'm very confused about this advice. I'm a very inexperienced runner, but to me, it sounds like cheating. Is the goal of the program to simply be able to run at any pace for 30 minutes straight, or to run a 5k within 30 minutes?

I'm attempting to follow the latter goal, by maintaining a constant 5k-in-30mins pace (9:13 minute/mile) across jogging sessions, but it is becoming very difficult. I'm not sure the program's progression is unrealistic, if I'm progressing uniquely poorly, or if I'm misunderstanding the program's expected goals...

I was a swimmer in my youth, but I didn't stick with it past high school. Starting in February, I got serious about getting into shape and losing weight. I was 5'11"" and weighed 260 lbs. I started walking, taking 20-30 minute walk breaks at work several times a day and walking the dog later, walking a total of 5-7 miles most days.

So 7 weeks ago I decided to try jogging. I started with the None to Run because I didn't feel like I could handle it. And 30 seconds of running at a time was pretty tough by the end of the workout. But I kept going. Upped it. Eventually I felt like I was outpacing that and switched to C25k. But then 2 weeks ago I decided to just run and see what I could do, I made it a mile. Did it again, made a mile and a half. Then last week, I made it 2 miles. First on the treadmill, but then repeated that twice over the past week outside, slightly increasing my pace each time.

So today, exactly 7 weeks from when I started, I told myself that if I could go 20 minutes, 31 minutes is not that much more. I got on the treadmill, put on Falcon and Winter Soldier, and just went for it. 5 minute walking warm up at 3 MPH, 32 minutes at 6 MPH, then about a 10 minute cool down at 3 MPH.

89,I always said I hate running‚Ä¶,"TL;DR: I was slowly mentally and physically deteriorating and didn‚Äôt think I was or ever could be a runner. I finally decided to try to change my inner thoughts, attach a few rewards to running, and found an app that helps me ‚Äúgamify‚Äù the C25K process. 

This post is as much for me as I hope it can be for other people. I would read posts here and think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs really awesome for them! I wish I was like them!‚Äù In the back of my mind also thinking that it was impossible for me to be like any of you. I have never been ‚Äúathletic.‚Äù I have never been competitive or into sports. I always said that I hate working out to ‚Äúwork out,‚Äù and that I especially hated running and I would never be a runner. I always enjoyed doing things that I liked that didn‚Äôt feel like working out - yoga, hiking, skiing, biking, tennis (without keeping score), etc. As I‚Äôve gotten older, most of this has gotten harder to keep up with. I have no friends to play tennis with. I have a few injuries that keep me from doing things like that or rock climbing. I have no car to go to my favorite hiking trails or ski resorts. No money for yoga. After COVID and a recent mass shooting a couple of blocks from my house, I‚Äôve become more scared than I‚Äôd like to admit to bike or walk to a lot of places that I normally would. I‚Äôve been on FMLA leave for MDD. I‚Äôm getting treatment, but regardless of that my life has felt like it was disintegrating before my eyes. I knew I needed to change something but I didn‚Äôt know what I could possibly do. 
I remembered running. I wouldn‚Äôt need any fancy equipment - I already had tennis shoes, so all I needed was a few pieces of workout clothes. I wouldn‚Äôt need an expensive gym membership - the world is my gym. I remembered C25K from many years ago when I thought I would do this to get in shape, but that wasn‚Äôt enough motivation. However, now I would be doing it for my mental health, and, in many ways, for my survival. I wanted to simply feel good in a world where I haven‚Äôt in a very long time. 
Initially, I doubted all of it. ‚ÄúI hated running.‚Äù ‚ÄúOther people can run and feel good, but not me.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not built like other people.‚Äù 
Thankfully, I pushed through and made a few small steps before getting started. I began by going on more walks - nothing crazy, just a couple times per week. I noticed I felt okay after that, and it was good for my dog, as well. I also recognized that my inner thoughts had become a prison of my own making. It‚Äôs a fact that I am a human. So I‚Äôm definitely built like everyone else, even if I have injuries others don‚Äôt have. I don‚Äôt like when other people limit my potential, or when I see others limiting the potential of those around them, so why was I doing this to myself? I‚Äôve also always said that if you can walk you can hike, if you can hike you can snowshoe, if you can snowshoe you can cross-country ski, if you can XC ski you can downhill ski‚Ä¶ so why would I skip over running?! It‚Äôs just ‚Äúspirited walking‚Äù, if you will. I don‚Äôt need to be Usain Bolt to be ‚Äúa runner.‚Äù I just need to run. I also listened to a podcast on habits and behavior, and knew that I would need to somehow attach a reward to the act of running since ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù I got a few pieces of running clothing that make me feel good to wear them. I also like podcasts, but I knew that wouldn‚Äôt be enough of a reward to keep it up. Luckily, I also found this silly but awesome app called ‚ÄúZombies, Run!‚Äù that has a C25K option. I just went on my second outing today. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was actually smiling like an idiot while also enjoying a super interesting podcast! I also found that I can go on trails near my house so I can be close to nature, which is also really motivating for me - it‚Äôs peaceful and relaxing. It‚Äôs also not in a gym or on a road where I feel like people are staring at me (even if they‚Äôre not).
I get that it‚Äôs only day 2, but it has already had unexpected benefits. I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm eating better; I suspect my body craves different things to give it fuel. I also thought because of COVID, depression, and my general health that my brain was deteriorating, but my mind actually feels sharper! If this is what two days can do, I can‚Äôt wait to see what more has in store for me. 
If you‚Äôre anything like me, I hope you find your path to getting started. It will always be the hardest part. If you can do that, you can continue on knowing that you‚Äôve already conquered the most difficult part of your journey. Also, the first week really is doable. I was seriously afraid it would be above my level, but now I truly think anyone can do this! As the name says, it really is *couch* to 5k!

91,Just finished W5D1... feeling like this is becoming a routine now!!,"Hey everyone!! I finished W4D3 yesterday, woke up this morning - it should've been one of my rest days - and... felt itching to run?!? Was a little nervous seeing 5 minute intervals but I got out there even with an ongoing rain warning (never actually ended up raining at all) and had a really good run. There's an unfortunate hill on my route so I struggled a little bit going up that today but I didn't feel lightheaded or wasn't gasping for air when I finished the last interval. I'm thinking I should start to convert some of my ""off days"" into strength days so I can work on building up muscle in my legs for powering up hills in the future.

Hi,

I noticed that my cardiovascular system is broken.

So I havent worked out for like half a year properly. I excpect to lose my fitness. I also gained weight (lost a bit through this month via fasting).

Before fasting my resting hr was 70ish
Now it can reach 50s. But its due to not eating for some time.
Anyways I do lots of walking now (20-30km a day) and I can walk it fine. My hr is usually 120 when I walk.
However today I tried a little light jog, just for fun. I think I wont go back to running but that was strange. I jogged like for 15 sec uphill (heck not even 15s, more like 10) and my hr instantly jumped into 150s and i felt like death and my legs started burning after 5sec.

I got covid last year and my vitamin D levels were low for so long I had to stop running due to shin splints. I got that mostly fixed I‚Äôm using the program to ease back in or I know I‚Äôll overdo it and injure myself. 

Im I‚Äôm week 5 now with some challenge, but it‚Äôs always attainable. The thing is I remember on my long runs I never felt ‚Äúwarmed up‚Äù until almost 2 miles in. And when you do this program for most of it you‚Äôre not hitting 2 miles total. So I‚Äôm not sure 5 minutes is a true warm up.. or is it just me? I suppose it depends on your goals. But if it feels like a slog to you, maybe you need to give your body longer to loosen up. 

I was looking at the other weeks and I‚Äôm intimidated, I admit. Although I ran long distances before, I never ran 25-30 minutes straight! So I‚Äôm excited to try it but also it does feel like a huge jump week to week.

29,Weeks for 10K?,"Hi everyone,

I have a 5km race coming up in August. After that, I‚Äôd like to train for a 10K, half, and eventually a full marathon. 

The marathon I plan (well- it‚Äôs a dream right now) to run is in May. I know training is doable but I‚Äôm trying to figure out how many weeks it‚Äôll take me to train for each distance consecutively. 

From the C210k app, it seems as though for from 5-10k it‚Äôs 6-7 weeks, and 10K-half is 12 weeks. Is this correct?

i started c25k in late 2019, running in a gym. ran fairly consistently, only breaking when i went on holiday, and was at the penultimate week when the pandemic arrived and the gym shut. i didn't want to run in the park because of how crowded it was at the time, so i stopped running for a few months. 

in the summer i decided to go for a run in the park, and over-estimated my ability. i think i did a week 6 or 7 run, which my body was not ready for given my many weeks of inactivity. i injured myself and since then i have not been able to run consistently. when the gym reopened in late summer i went back to the beginning of c25k but couldn't make it beyond the second week without knee pain/shin splints/sciatica. 

i decided to rest until the beginning of 2021, thinking this would be enough time to allow my knee to heal. in january i started running in the park, and ran occasionally over the next couple of months, never going beyond the first week of the course i think. i had pain in my ankles, and realised that my running shoes were worn out and part of the problem. i bought new running shoes, and decided to let everything rest until university ended in the summer.

i went on my first run in my new shoes on sunday (going back to the beginning of c25k), and have the expected muscle ache. i'm going to wait for that to go away before i do my next run. i still feel a little twinge in my knee every now and then, and wonder if it needs more rest.

69,"C25K, or how I learned to stop worrying and love running","*TL;DR: Wasn‚Äôt doing well physically and mentally. Enter: C25K.*

In late March, at the onset of summer 2021, I found myself in a slump.

It began in late 2020. Just like most people in my country, I started losing my loved ones. While attending my grandfather‚Äôs funeral, I caught COVID myself which had long-lasting symptoms. I work in sales, so it was super hard to concentrate on the job. Had a few setbacks there. I started falling into a downward spiral from October 2020. To add to that, my eight-year-old relationship with an amazing person came to an end in late February.

At that point, I found myself to be clinically depressed, anxiety-riddled, and pretty much finished.

Apart from being mentally sick, there were clear physical indications of the fall. When you‚Äôre in this phase - you keep trying to fill the gaps by latching on to anything you find comfortable. I latched on to a sedentary lifestyle. I sat on the couch all day, worked, played video games, watched Netflix, and did a lot of stress eating. Every day. Sixteen hours. That‚Äôs all I did.

One day I stood on the scale and found myself being close to 80 KG (around 176 lbs). I wasn‚Äôt overweight, but I was getting dangerously close to the dreaded BMI of 25. There were clear signs of this too. I found myself huffing and puffing after taking 10 flights of stairs. I couldn‚Äôt keep my speed up beyond a couple of hundred meters before my lungs gave up. Had so much fat that I lost my jawline. My body just wanted to stay on the couch all day.

I started therapy, but it wasn‚Äôt helping that much. 

One fine day, in late March, at the onset of summer 2021, I said this was it. 

I promised myself that before my birthday this year I am taking my body back to what it was in high school. Stronger, lighter, and agile. 

I started CICO and intermittent fasting. But that wasn‚Äôt enough. I had to do something for my stamina, agility, and core. The easiest way I found was running. But I feel like every runner who is reading this can relate to it: it‚Äôs not easy for someone to start from being a couch potato to running long distances. To add to that, I never did any substantial physical activity after high school and had reduced lung capacity post-COVID. I kept searching in forums after forums to find a solution for this - until I hit r/C25K. I went through the top posts of all time, read through the comments, and found all of you amazing people.

When I started it, it seemed like an impossible goal. I had to start and stop a few days in the middle of the program due to restrictions in my country, had to push really hard through the fifth week, had some minor injuries.

Today, on 25th June 2021, I found that everything was worth it. I hit the mark. Ran for five kilometers non-stop. I also hit 68 KG (150 lbs) and found myself to be in one of the best shapes of my life. Now I aim to get better, day by day.

Not only this, waking up early in the morning to run fixed my daily routine. I was able to get a lot off my mind via running. The endorphin release really lifted me as well. I was always body-conscious and didn‚Äôt post any photos on Instagram. [Today was the first time I posted one](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQitoE5DFoE/). 

C25K seems like a simple running program for beginners on the surface, but it changed my life in many ways. I cannot overstate how much you guys - whom I don‚Äôt even personally know, helped me through a tough time in my life. The neat little program pushed me to a lifetime of keeping my fitness up and intact.

If someone like me who‚Äôs exploring this board and wondering if they should start C25K - do it. Please do it. This small, simple program will genuinely change the way you will approach fitness.",C25K,1624623453,RishankJhavar,6,1,True,2021-06-25

82,Confused about the different C25K versions?,"Hello, i just started the C25K program in the hopes to slowly improve my cardio and lungs while having chronic pain of the neck and head. So far so good, in a flair by the end of the run, but it was day two today and that was already better than day one so I'd say success. And also I wouldn't push myself so hard if I didn't think I had more in me than my body wants to give. It's been down for so long. The pain is quickly coming down after each run right now, so I'd say that it's probably the irritation of inflammation and increased blood flow in the moment, but maybe this will help with tolerance too. And yes before anyone comes for me, I work closely with my docs, I'm good to go here.

Question from title: I am really confused about all the different versions of C25K our there and saw that the version in the menu here is different than the version I found here
https://www.runnersblueprint.com/couch-to-5k/
Am I allowed to post here first off if I use this version? What's the benefits of the version posted to this page versus some of the others? I used this one cause it seemed to have a bit of a better build up in the first weeks and I really don't have any stamina. I'm already taking my puffer before I go, and bringing it just Incase (but I did not need it during today, yay).

Also holy heck I die of heat by the time I'm home. I definitely need some Biker shorts or running shorts if anyone has recommendations I'd love you! And does everyone carry their water bottles? What do I do?
How do you guys plan your runs for the right amount of distance or time? I didn't want to use the app as I have a fitbit and would rather track there and it can do the intervals for me.

I did week 1 for 1.5 weeks, week 2 for 3 weeks and just started my third week of week 3. The runs are still challenging but not impossible and nothing hurts after. I am 7 weeks into running and don't feel like quitting at all. If you are like me, out of shape, middle aged (I'm late 30s) and have started and stopped this program countless times don't lose hope.

First time posting here; this sub has been great for motivation.

Hoping to get some tips/advice. I finally finished the C25K programme around a month ago, completing a 5k in just over 30 mins. Following my first run after completing the programme I noticed pain in my left calf which stopped me from running again until now. I'm planning on starting again from W1D1 tomorrow and am hoping to incorporate some strength training on my off days since a lot of people on here suggest that to prevent injury. I don't have any training equipment so would appreciate any suggestions of simple exercise routines I could do at home to build up strength?

68,"Former 20 mile a week runner, using program to ease back in post covid","I‚Äôm 36 and been an athlete all my life, was running 20 miles a week in my late 20s at peak fitness. I kept running up until last spring when I got covid, and I‚Äôve had vitamin D issues ever since. It was so bad I could jog 10 feet and get debilitating shin splints, my legs felt like they were made of wood. So I basically only speed walked all last year, though it has not effected my lifting much. 

I got my levels up, tho not to 100%, and am using the program to ease back in and make sure the shin splints don‚Äôt come back. I‚Äôm on week 4 with no issues so far. I am glad for my history with running, makes it easier, though I admit I‚Äôve never run a 5k without stopping. I‚Äôm excited for it, and to challenge myself in new ways.

I‚Äôm someone who genuinely enjoys running, and actually I get a little cranky if I don‚Äôt run a few times a week. It‚Äôs like meditation for me - it‚Äôs my get away where I am not stressed about anything, and I consider my life and the choices I need to make.

74,Questions/Help (Just Starting Out),"Hi! I have (halfheartedly) tried to start running so many times before in my life. This is the first time that I feel like it could actually stick and I don't want to mess it up. I am about 15 lb overweight (according to BMI) and have horrible cardio fitness and a very high heart rate (I have since I was a child) so when I'm going hard during cardio my heartrate can go as high as 207 (that's the max I've seen, I try not to let it get that high... I usually hover around 190 while doing C25K). 

I started going for 2 mile walks a few months ago and using the elliptical at the gym 2-3x a week. I can \*finally\* run for a minute or two (but usually heart pounding and panting hard by the end) so I began C25K once again. Week 1 was pretty difficult for me, but week 2 is a lot easier? I don't think it's because I've gotten drastically better in a few days though - the extra 30 seconds of walking makes a tremendous difference for me and then I can easily run the next 1.5 minutes. Is this normal? I thought week 2 should have been harder? 

Also, I know people have probably asked this many times and I've searched the internet a lot, but what's the best thing to do about shin splints and side stitches? Today I had a side stitch before I even started running.

76,Week 6 Day 3 failed,"Hey guys, I've been lurking for a while and finally making my first post, really just here to rant in order to help me let off some steam. I'm really angry and disappointed with myself. I started c25k last year (failing many times throughout) and got to week 8 day 1 and quit due to depression-fueled laziness. Came back this year and I ran Weeks 1 through 3 without breaks because I was desperate to catch up again. Failed W4D1, came back two days later and completed it then I started taking 1 day breaks between runs as I figured I wore myself out by blasting through W1 to W3 without rest. After that I completed week 4 no problem still taking the 1 day breaks.

I made it through week 5 and it was my best week so far. Each day felt better and better leading up to W5D3. I struggled through the halfway point of W5D3 but will powered myself to finish the whole 20 minutes and I felt like I could've run about ten more minutes once I got to the end.

W6D1 was so easy that I was complaining about the lack of difficulty when I finished. W6D2 became extremely difficult due to the walking cooling me down then having to ramp back up. The second 10 minute run was very difficult and I was losing breath in the last few minutes but I just powered through it. Waited a day and attempted W6D3 this morning and I got to about 14/15 minute mark and I failed (I run for time not distance, on treadmill). The pain I can usually fight through (chest tightness/mild heartburn feeling) really got to me. Head kept dropping and losing posture and I kept having to grab the handles of the treadmill. My lungs weren't giving out, my legs, knees, and feet didn't hurt; I just suddenly quit. Once I quit I tried to jump back on a minute later and ran about two more minutes then failed again and I stopped.  W5D3 was so doable for me but I failed basically the same run a week later. I plan to repeat W6D3 two days from now like I did with W4 and  I will keep pushing but I was so confident I was never going to fail again.",C25K,1623697375,throwaway_7926,3,6,True,2021-06-14

I‚Äôm visiting my in-laws in Florida for the first time since things opened back up. I picked a loop around the neighborhood that I did 4 times, each lap a little slower than the last.

I've mainly worn Nike and brooks shoes without paying any thought to the actual type of shoe they were, thinking that having a good brand is all that mattered. I was barely able to do half of w1d1 when getting back into the program a few weeks ago without my shins and soles of my feet causing me a lot of problems, even after getting some dr scholls inserts. This discouraged me greatly.

The PSA of this comes here, I'm flat footed and have a fairly wide foot, I finally decided I would try to research a new shoe and get ones that have a description tailored to a situation like mine. I got a pair of Asics Gel Kayanos and it has absolutely changed my outlook on running and walking. If you're in a situation where you believe you're getting shin splints due to being out of shape for a while or just first getting into running and you're uninformed like I was, I would HIGHLY recommend looking into a pair of shoes such as this.

I did W1D2 today and after finishing both this run and my first one, I experienced a crazy rush of emotions and just felt all around incredible and euphoric and generally emotional (got close to crying today for no discernible reason) for a solid 10-15 mins after I finished. At first I thought it was just me being proud of myself for trying a new thing and succeeding but then it happened again. It feels really intense and today I was literally walking through the woods with a huge idiot grin on my face during my cool down walk. 

I‚Äôve read about runners high where if you run for like 40+ mins straight you can sometimes end up feeling euphoric and like you could run forever, but this specific mood didn‚Äôt make running easier or anything.

 5 or so years ago I was up to  week 7 or 8 of C25K, running on a treadmill, a lot of the time i could  run a full 3-4KM, then I was in a car crash. nothing serious but enough  to stop me working out again for a long time. over the last 6 months I  would be breathless just walking up the stairs one story, a 15 minute  walk with my dog would leave me exhausted. each time I tried to restart I'd get to maybe week 2 but back pain would cause me to stop or just tiredness from working (i travel 2 hrs each way to the office, leaving at 6am and getting home about 730).

the  lockdown gave me the motivation to start again, i repeat each week twice before moving on to the next because I know my fitness isnt enough at the end of each week to move to the next week. right now I cant seem  to get past week4. i can complete the whole time but I'm fit to collapse  after it. So I tend to repeat the week over and over, I havent worked out in a week because of lack of motivation by what i see as the wall in front of me.

58,First outdoor run advice (W7D1),"Hey all, long time lurker, first time poster. I've found this community and reading everyone's stories really interesting.

So for the first six weeks of this challenge I've done every single run on the treadmill. Mostly because I do 12 hour shifts (with 1hr commute by public transport either side) and it's so much quicker for me to take a gym bag to work or go to the sister gym five mins from my house, change, do the run on the treadmill and then wash and finish than do an outdoor run in my urban city.

It's been very tough, my purpose of doing this challenge was to improve my stamina after having covid and generally improve my fitness. However I feel like I'm making progress, upping my walking speed from 5kmph to 6.5k and running from 8.5 to 10 over the weeks and doing my first 5k on W6D3.

However this week I'm visiting my parents and there's no gym nearby so I did my first outdoor run and it was so tough. I definitely didn't run for 25 mins straight but it felt like 1 min on, 1 min off the whole time. For me how I run is the first five minutes is hell I want to stop every ten seconds and then I find my pace and I manage to continue to the end, although I transform into a very sweaty tomato by the end.

I know there were some factors out of my control - to get to the open green space I ran I had to go along a road where there was only a narrow pavement one side and no way to get past people safely, it was really windy and I nearly fell over ten times from the slippy mud but I'm still upset at myself for barely running. 

Would you guys call this a week off and still do three outdoor runs and not log them but do week seven next week when I can go back to a treadmill? Or do you say count these three runs and go straight into week 8 on schedule next week?

74,My first and unplanned (and a very slow) 10k,"**Training**

I ran my first 5k in Sep 2020 and been running at least 2-3 times/week since then (there were two 3-week period I didn't do any runs in that period). Usually it will be a 3k,4k, and 5k in a week or sometimes an easy 3,3,5, or rarely when I'm ambitious a 5,5,5. 

Ran my first 6k in December, 7k and 8k in March, but then it was mostly dis-organized. I couldn't stick to any plans and I thought I'm going to forever stuck around the 7k mark. I was too lazy to cross train, didn't go to gym even though I had access to most gyms for a very little fee from work. 

During this period, my 5k pace swung from 29:00 to 38:00. I struggled to finish 3k at days and did few easy 5ks. I was unpredictable. 

**Past injuries** 

I had pains on my left foot and on my right shin since January. After trying various socks, different lacing techniques, and going back and forth between two shoes, I figured the cause of pain on my left foot. I wore thinner socks and freed up my left shoe using a lacing technique. After bullying my wife to watch all my runs and running behind me with a phone videoing, I figured I was over pronating on my right leg. It might sound too farfetched, but just identifying the problem and a five-minute mindful training of foot striking fixed my pain on my right shin. 

**Pre-race (Food and Mindset)**

Japanese chicken curry and a generous portion of carrot cake for lunch at 12. A cup of tea at 5pm just before I went for the run. 
There is this moment when I got out of the lift and I had this thought that I would do a 10k. This is after not finishing a 5k two days ago and didn‚Äôt run more than 5k in the last two months. 
Usual warm-up of 10 mins. I made sure I hit the bathroom twice, even though I didn't find the calling.

I told myself I'm not in a hurry to get out of the park anytime soon. And I should never want to stop running or get out of breath or think about going back home. I prepared myself not to have any thoughts about running, or post running, or future plans, or pace while I'm running. All of this could wait till I finish running. 

**Running**

I read somewhere that you cannot start slower (advising a slow start). I was constantly mindful of my breaths and my legs striking the ground during the first 3k. I personally find the first 3k hardest because it's so easy to stop running and go back. I was very conscious not to overdo the kms between 3 and 5. I wasn't looking at my watch during the whole run but listened for the km beep. I was still running very comfortably and not catching breath when I crossed 5k. 

I usually get a freezing sensation on my left foot when I near 5K and then it passes away after running a few hundred meters. I had it again; it came and went. Another usual pain on the lower side of my right gut when I near 7K, which also, vanishes after running a few hundred meters. I didn't experience it yesterday and now I think it's because I would have overstrained previously. All good so far. 

The 2ish kms between km 5 and 7 was purely a bliss. It was unbelievably joyous and felt heavenly. I know I wasn't running fast, but I felt my form and posture to be perfect and I was flying or sailing across. It could be runners high and I found effortlessly crossing 7K. 

I hit 8k, the farthest I've ever run so far. I couldn't afford to lose now, and I became very vigilant of the surroundings. I know if I stop for a single moment, I wouldn't continue running.  I was very mindful of, 

- dogs without leashes
- footballs flying across me
- kids walking/running/cycling straight into me
- roadwork that cut straight across the run path at one end
- each strike of the leg
- each breath I took

I was still doing good and just before the 9k alert came in. I developed a new pain on my left heel and ankle. The feeling was new and strange, and it was the only time during the whole run I thought I might not finish. The beep on the 9k took a long time to come and I was so determined to finish running through the pain. I ran with this pain till I finished the 10k. 
 

**Post-race**

I realized I was running slow but didn't realize it took me 1:18:00. When I finished my first 5k last year, I wanted my 10k in less than 1:10:00. Nevertheless, I'm very happy and contend and the slow pace don't bother me one bit. There is one thing I can tell with certainty- If I were ever, even once, checked my pace during the run, I would have been so disheartened and disappointed, and it would have impacted my finish. I was so lazy to cool down or to stretch. 

I drank heaps of water, an effervescent hydration, a vit B&amp;C (I had one. Not sure if it's advisable, but heck I ran 10K and I might need it), a glass of orange juice, spoonsful of peanut butter and a nut bar before I had a proper dinner later. I'm not going to write how disappointed I was to find my fav. charcoal chicken place closed and how I ran out of eggs for dinner. 

I'm dreaming of a half marathon now. Funny, I've reached goals where marathon is written in it. I'd love to do it in 2:22:22. Why? Just because that's fancy and why not?

I logged into Smashrun and it said this funny thing - That‚Äôs a lot of k‚Äôs you just ran. If all those k‚Äôs were fingers you‚Äôd have a handshake. If they were bowling pins you‚Äôd have a strike. If they were commandments you‚Äôd be Moses. But since those k‚Äôs are kilometers, you get this super-neato badge!


I finally think I can comment/post on /r/running. 

I wish you the very best in running and like heaps of people who've said before me, discipline is what's going to get us across. Keep running the odd 2ks and the 3ks and learn to run slow.

80,"New to this, had to stop once because of pain but I don't want it to happen again","Hey guys, I'm writing cause I keep searching for posts but can't find one in my situation. I'm 25yo, 5'8'', and 140 pounds or so. Given my weight I thought I shouldn't have a problem with my legs, but the damn things are trying to give up on me every two weeks haha.

I started the program 6/7 weeks ago, did the first two weeks and had to stop because I had knee pain, and it persisted afterwards any time I moved, even if I was just walking inside my house. I stopped for a month, got new running shoes, and resumed it last week, did W2 again and now I'm finally at the end of W3. 

The endurance part is mostly fine for me, getting a bit harder as the weeks go on (as it should), but I'm starting to have leg issues again! This time I started doing [these](https://www.healthline.com/health/itb-stretches) after my runs to avoid the knee pain, and luckily didn't have problems with them again, but now my ankles and left shin hurt/burn while I'm doing the jogging parts. I can walk just fine in the walking intervals, and don't feel any pain when I'm done with the session, but during the jogging intervals I just can't finish them because it starts to hurt.

According to the threads I've been reading, it could be because I run heels first, but I've also tried to land with the upper part of my feet and had no luck, also tried running slower but it's the same (maybe I have to take a break for a few weeks so my legs recover and try those two again?).

So my question is how can I improve this situation for the next time I resume the training? Should I add ankle and shin stretching exercises to my cooldown interval? Are my bones/joints just bad ones and this will keep happening unless I take it way slower than the 8 weeks the program suggests? Or it's just a sign that my legs aren't used to me running three times a week? (never did any exercises like this before, just weightlifting at the gym and casual cycling).",C25K,1622000934,atomicperson,4,1,True,2021-05-25

 I've had a few injuries so far as well, running on hard pavement was killing my knees so I moved to the mulch paths that I lucky have in a park near where I live, which totally solved all my knee issues, now I've got a bum ankle that's been messing with me and I have to wear an ankle brace for most of the day (my job involves me on my feet moving around the whole workday) it's made things slightly better but I've definitely had to be clever with my testing and self care, but I'm still trying to get out there 4-5 times a week!

95,Trying to find my C25K,"TLDR; Any thoughts on repeating a week until it‚Äôs boring or doing one WK per month?

This is my 4th or 5th time attempting C25K. For context on my fitness, I‚Äôm a fairly average late 20s person with a slightly stocky build who has never had an exercise routine in their life. I‚Äôve been doing light yoga daily for a few months for back pain, and have done yoga classes in the past, and can cycle 40 minutes across the city occasionally.

I‚Äôve tried Zombies Run C25K twice and have gotten half way, and now I‚Äôm doing the NHS C25K while listening to the ZR main mission.

Anyways, I‚Äôve never been able to get past week 4 in terms of a routine, injuries, and being discouraged by ‚Äúfailed‚Äù runs. 

So I‚Äôm trying something new. I just ran for the 5th time this month, all WK1. They‚Äôre always challenging, the middle one I could barely finish. 

Anyways, am I a wuss or a genius doing each WK until I feel comfortable with it? I feel like I‚Äôm young and healthy (but not fit) and should be able to complete it at a normal pace? But maybe lowering the bar and making it feel doable will help me get into a routine?

I wake up at 6am, leave the house at 6:30, and decided to go down streets with not many other people who are on their morning walk. The funny thing is, the dogs had the same idea. I walked in on a pack that decided to intimidate me by growling and running at me until I turned around. There was this chill dog trotting beside with me, but then this other chill dog thought I was nice and decided to join in, but that made the first dog angry. Finally there was this dog that walked a few paces behind me while I was walking, but when I started jogging, it decided that I was it's prey or something. It jumped up and wrapped it's front paws around my left arm, and I stopped and growled ""what the fuck"" instinctively, and the dog decided I had too much fat and not enough protein for a proper meal.

I survived all this unscathed, but I think I'm going to plot out my course a little better for the day after tomorrow. Maybe I'll borrow my neighbor's pitbull for a little muscle.

50,Heart Rate Refuses to Plateau -- Help?,"I just finished W6D2 this morning.  Wasn't too tough, though I'm sure going to miss those walking breaks!  So, I'm in my mid-40's, and I've got a bit of tachycardia (falls into the ""inappropriate"" category, if that helps).  I've had good results with using a beta blocker over the past couple months, which has reduced my resting HR by a good 15+ BPM.  No other symptoms. No side effects that I've noticed. As far as the running itself, I'm on the heavier side (just shy of 200 lbs.), and I pronate.  From previous experience running, I try to keep cadence high and land mid-foot to avoid stress to knees. I've been trying to stick to a pace of 11:00/mile, as too much faster than that, and I get gassed.  My main focus is simply:  complete each day's run, and I haven't failed thus far. 

So, here's the issue:  when I start running, my heart rate increases, and it does so steadily and surely.  It doesn't ever plateau, it just keeps rising.  When I did my W5D3 20-minute run last week, by the end of it my HR was 187 BPM.  I know from experience that when I get into the 190s (I've even hit 200 before, early on when the intervals were shorter and I would run paces as fast as 9:00/mile) it's unsustainable...I can't continue for more than a minute or two at that pace.  If you take a look at my splits from this morning (charts below), in the first run (10 minutes) I started the run segment at around 120 BPM and steadily rose to 162 BPM.  After the 3 minutes of walking, I had dropped down to 126 BPM.  When I started running again, I quickly (within 2 minutes) was right back to 162, and it continued rising for the remainder of the run, peaking out at 180 at the end.   My pace was nearly identical for the two splits (I was actually about 0:12 slower for the 2nd running split).  

So, hopefully my concern is probably pretty obvious: ""How can I possibly run for 25 minutes without getting crushed by an out of control heart rate?""  I can certainly try to slow my pace down, but once I get much below 11:00/mile, it just feels more ""jarring"" on the body.  Perhaps I should slow down my cadence?  I don't know.  Any suggestions y'all have would be appreciated.  And I'll go ahead and save everyone the trouble:  no advice that anyone gives will be considered as medical advice, and I absolve you all from threats of legal action based upon any suggestions taken or ignored.

94,Leg and foot pain,"Hi!  I'm a 22 year old female and did the first 6 weeks of this program with relatively few issues (really had to push through sometimes, but always made it). However, I have been stuck on W7 for about 6 weeks now. Sometimes, I can do 25 minutes, but usually I have to take a small break in the middle or even a few more. What I seem to suffer from the most, and what's making me have to walk, is leg and foot pain. It's hard to describe, but feels mostly just like an overall pretty bad ache, down from my knee to the tips of my toes. Sometimes, it's accompanied by sharper pains in my knees/ankles. My legs feel really heavy and kind of cramped up. 

I make sure to do some basic calf &amp; thigh stretches before and after running, and I got my shoes from a professional running shop (Brooks Adrenaline with extra padding under the soles because of overpronation). I'm also pretty sure I'm not running too fast. Often, I do also feel out of breath and my chest feels tight, like I can't breathe in deep enough. I don't eat 2 hours before I go running, and also try not to drink too much beforehand.

Hey everyone, 

I'm a student at Loughborough University doing a Masters in Exercise Physiology. My research project is on the Couch to 5k app, investigating the effects that doing it has on your physical, mental and nutritional health. Although C25k has been incredibly popular for several years, there's been very little scientific research published on it, so we're hoping to change that! If we can find positive benefits then we hope that can increase funding and awareness of the C25k program, meaning more people can experience the awesome process of beginning to run.

We're currently in the participant recruitment stage of the study, and are looking for people who already want to do the C25k app. If you participate, then we simply ask you to complete 3 surveys - one before you start, one about 5 weeks in and one at the end. Each survey will take you about 20 minutes, and asks questions on topics such as your physical activity levels, your sleep and your diet. 

If anyone would be interested in participating, then please send me a message with your email address and I can send you further information, and then if you're still interested the initial survey as well. Recruitment is open from now until May 14th.

Thanks everyone, and enjoy your running!

2,I finished my first 5km today after ditching the app at the end of Week 5. Here's why.,"I started C25K in mid-February with the NHS/Public Health England app. I struggled for motivation for the first few weeks, particularly as I was running after work and finding it hard to go out after a busy day. I persisted, though, and even though there were often four, five or six days between my runs, I got to Week 5. I was regularly adding time onto the last run of a session, at one point pushing myself to eight minutes running instead of five. 

Around the start of Week 4, I woke early one day and decided to go out before work. That's where the change happened. I noticed I had more energy and focus during the day and my sense of humour stayed intact well into the evening. I felt refreshed and rejuvenated and accomplished, and that's stuck with me since then. I set my alarm earlier to get a better morning routine, and all my runs have been morning runs since. 

At the end of Week 5, you run 20 minutes non-stop. I was intimidated by this run but I trusted the programme and believed I had it in me. I prepared for the run by inserting an off-programme 5-minute run, 90-second walk X4 session two days before my attempt.

The time for my 20-minute run came. I paced myself and ran at a steady pace for 22¬Ω minutes. I was over the moon, and that's when the bug started.

I looked at the rest of the C25K programme and felt like the progression wasn't fast enough for me. I understand the programme is designed for gradual gains and to help not get injured by pushing too hard, but I always felt like I had more to give during my runs, so I stepped things up myself.

I ran every other day for 26 minutes, 30 minutes, 26 minutes at my best per-km pace, and this morning I went out with my partner, secretly aimed for 5km, and smashed it.

I'm not suggesting you do this. I said above that the programme is designed to limit the chances of injury and build fitness at a steady pace. I'm overweight, in my mid-40s, my gear is cheap and my shoes are second-hand, but I always felt like I had more to give and more to gain.

I do recommend finishing the programme as it's designed, and I feel somewhat bad that I won't officially ""graduate"" Couch25k, but let me say this: do what works for you. Repeat a run, or a week, if you need to. Push yourself harder if you feel like you've got it in you. Before Week 5, the programme teaches you to pace yourself, and that comes in very handy for the final push to 5km.

Keep up the great work, and keep going. I hadn't run for more than a bus in thirty years, since school. I've definitely got the bug now and I'm aiming for trail running in future.

18,Will I eventually get used to using ‚Äòcorrect running form‚Äô ? My calves are holding me back.,"Everything is going well ; I don‚Äôt have trouble keeping up with the program at all as far as my cardio is concerned but goodness , my calves are not used to the ‚Äòcorrect technique‚Äô of running on the forefoot.

At the end of my runs my calves especially my lower calves feel so tight like they‚Äôre gonna cramp up at any moment. It‚Äôs really holding me back because I feel like I can pick up my pace as far as my cardiovascular endurance goes, but the pain in my calves holds me back.

I‚Äôm naturally a heel striker, I‚Äôve always been. So literally the first few steps I took running on my forefoot/toes I felt my calves and shins being strained. I pushed through it because ‚Äòcorrect form!‚Äô But I‚Äôm beginning to doubt if I can complete the longer runs that are around the corner , like the full 8 minute runs a few days from now (week 5)

Should I continue pressing on with the correct running technique and hope that I adapt or should I revert back to my old form, to finish the program at all costs? I don‚Äôt want to take any extra days off outside of the normal 1 day between runs.

How many of you had a seamless transition to forefoot running as a natural heelstriker?

Has anyone said ‚Äòscrew it‚Äô and just stuck with their normal running technique and completed the program that way?

30,Calves and shins burn almost immediately,"I'm trying to get back into running again with a C25k, but it's been tough. I've done about 5-6 really short run/walks (about 1 min of jogging and 1-2 min of walking for about 20 minutes) over 2-3 weeks, and I just completed my first week of C25k. Every time I run, I get a burning feeling ([what I've always understood to be lactic acid](https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/3bhfjl/starting_out_lactic_acid_in_calves_and_shins/csmdyek/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) in my lower leg (mostly in front and the outside, and all the way down to my ankle). By the time I finish my C25K set, my legs feel so tight and burn so much I feel like I couldn't run another 10 seconds. After I rest for 4-5 minutes, I feel totally fine and can walk home...I could probably even run another couple of sets. Most of my running has been on an asphalt track, so it's flat and fairly soft. I've done some walking and some very light dynamic stretching/warmups before my runs, but that doesn't seem to help. I've also tried slowing down quite a bit, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. I've also tried two different pairs of shoes‚ÄîI've used both before with no problems, and one is fairly new.

 I haven't run in about a year, but for the last 6 months or so, I've gone on walks nearly every day - always at least a mile, sometimes more like 3 - so it's not like my legs have completely atrophied. The walks also usually involve at least a few hills. 

I don't think this is shin splints, but maybe I'm wrong about what that feels like. I've always been really on and off with my running, and I've had this feeling on my first runs before, but it's never been quite this bad, and it's never lasted for as long.

I regularly walk 10k (3-4 times a week) and I've been wanting to get into running for a while. I used to run but I messed up my knee 6 years ago so I've been avoiding running since then.

Almost 24 hours later whilst walking to the shop I developed a deep pain on the side/back of my hip and that leg is very painful to move. I have two questions related to this:

Firstly, is it likely to be caused by the running or just a coincidence? I have had no pain during any of my runs and have been leaving at least 1 day rest between each run. If it is related to running, what steps can I take to help this heal and prevent it from recurring?

Secondly, I'm obviously not going to run W3D2 tomorrow if the pain is still there in the morning.

69,"Follow the plan, your body will thank you","Many of us, once we catch the running ‚Äòbug‚Äô want to do more.  Longer runs, more frequency, jump ahead.  My personal anecdotal with a smattering of reading&amp;research advice is this:  Don‚Äôt jump ahead.   You are building up things in your body that you don‚Äôt see or feel.  By adding additional mileage too soon one risks injury.  By adding frequency or speed too soon, one risks injury, little to no gains, and can even hamper ones aerobic base building.   

Stick to the plan- then add speed/frequency/ distance once done.

75,Starting again for the 4th time.,"I'm turning 50 in 2 weeks and I need to make a change. I'm 5'6"" on a good day and currently weigh 235lb. I have been over 200 for since the late 90's. I used to run a lot when I was younger and on active duty in the Army, but those days are long past. I started using the app the 1st time around 2014 or so and got as far as week 5 back then, Started again after I moved to Denver but never got too far there, the lower air pressure was just too much for me to overcome. Last summer I was up to week 6 day 1 and covid restrictions and a new job killed my progress.

&amp;#x200B;

I need to make a change and the longer I wait the harder it will be. I'm not sure this time will be anymore successful than the last several tries but if I give up now nothing will ever get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've worked really hard on my career and am in a pretty comfortable place now, I have a solid job making good money and I'm stable. I want to be healthy enough so that I can retire and still enjoy life. I'm so tired of being tired all the time. Parts of my body hurt all the time and the extra 60lb I'm carrying has a lot to do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I did week 1 day 1 Monday, it wasn't too bad. . I want to get to a place where my 3 weekly ""runs"" become routine and habitual. On the other days I do weights. I feel like I have all the knowledge to be successful, I just need to find the will power to actually do it.

I managed another 5K and I didn't even turn on the C25K app this time, preferring instead to just use Strava and to keep going until the distance counter said 5K. Strava says I did 5.01km and had a moving time of 36:05, but it awarded me a Silver medal for my 2nd fastest 5K time and says it was 37:27.. So I'm a touch confused by that. It felt worse than my other 5K and I stopped more to walk.   


There's a lot more concrete and a lot less green here in the city centre, which I am not a fan of, but the nearest large green space is 2.5km away... I'd be turning back home as soon as I got there. I also had to basically run to the front door in order to get to 5K, so I didn't get a warm-down walk although I did stretch afterwards.

As with all my runs in w7, I've found myself having to walk a bit but this has gotten less as the week has gone on. I decided to go further on my route though, which was fun and despite walking periods, I finished running at the 27 minute mark having made it back to my usual end-point and with a good pace. 

Another thing I've been doing with C25K is trying to touch my toes with my legs kept straight. It's part of my stretching routine anyway to stretch my posterior chain and especially my calves and hamstrings but I've always wanted to be able to touch my toes (I remember being able to do it as a kid, as well as put my leg behind my head). Last night I touched my toes! Well, toe. It was a very brief tap on my big toe, but I couldn't even get 1/2 way down my calves when I started so I am really happy with this win.

69,Thoughts about reaching 5k before finishing the program + why I changed it on the end of week 6 (images on post),"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0zgdw38kd5v61.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2053b216610df4f8ef5660ab06f5345b3abf8de

TL;DR: I'm fit, on week 6 I decided to change the program and instead of doing long runs, went back to  doing lots of smaller chunks, increasing running and decreasing walking. Felt that my performance was better compared to long runs, at the cost of increasing the session length. 

First of all, I'm somewhat fit. I was once a intermediate powerlifter and was pretty focused on boxing before the pandemic. Also, I'm using the [Emi version of the program](https://external-preview.redd.it/9GKGtoel2n1DjjUmn8XhL3_ISB22Ui8w6CPUqjeJj7w.png?auto=webp&amp;s=56f3664502e721e1fd6d1b983d5086d7eb3734f6).

When I started, I felt very good with the program, especially because I'm a fan of linear progression, so the idea of increasing a little bit the length of running while decreasing the length of walking sounds familiar to me, and in my ignorance about cardio and joints development, seems all good. 

Then I went to the intermediate weeks and I started to notice that the chunks got larger and larger, and the time in which I would only run, not walk anymore, felt nearer each running I did. And at the day 3 of week 5, the program tells you to drop completely the walking, and run 21 minutes straight. I found it odd, because on day 1 of week 6, you get back to walking again. Maybe the program had this 21 minutes day intended to be done at a friday, so you got 2 days of rest, and since I'm not consistent with my days, I felt it weird. Instead, I tried to somewhat keep with the pace of reducing walking, increasing running. 

The other day, I read an article about some flaws of C25k (which unfortunately I cant find it again; it was written by a girl IIRC), in which the author told that she (again, I'm not sure about the author's gender)  was against the restless running nature of the program, and instead of aiming towards nonstop running, she aimed to run into smaller chunks, kinda like the beginning of the program, and use some ""linear progression"" on it: increase a bit of running, decrease a bit of walking. It is supposed to make you have more running time (because you're distributing your rests more, maybe even resting more), at the cost of increase the time of your sessions.

So, I understand that those are different skills: being able to run long distances without walking, and being able to run somewhat fast, kinda like different goals on doing weights. And although I was aiming to run 30min nonstop at the beginning of my journey, after 1 session of running chunks of 3min running followed by 1 minute walking (and felt considerably better which almost the same pace and distance, at the cost of 3 extra minutes of my session) instead of 13minutes of running + 4minutes of walking + 13 minutes or running (which was supposed to be my next session), I decided to give the smaller chunks a try, decreasing walking time by 10 seconds, increasing running time by... maybe 30 seconds per chunk?

With the slight increase in run length, I decided to spend more time trail running this week rather than just extending my pavement running and ended up staying in the woods for at least 10 minutes (usually I get maybe 30 seconds in the woods). Trail running is so much more enjoyable! It made the run 100x better, so this felt like a really good run and I even grabbed a bit of wild garlic on the way for a mid-run energy boost (okay not that much energy, but definitely delicious).

8,Advice for Weeks 7-9 and keeping things interesting.,"So I'm working through the NHS C25K programme and today I just completed Week 7 Day 1 which was my second 25 min run. 

Looking ahead the plan looks a little boring, same 3 runs each week with just a small increment in time. Probably doesn't help that this is my third time doing C25K (two three-year breaks for my babies) and previously the programmes I followed were a bit more dynamic (zombies run, &amp; endomono).

I'm thinking about varying the type of run I do, maybe one trail/hill run , one easy (z2 footpath) run and then the third a moderate run, building to graduation 'race'? The trainer did say to vary your route!

11,Is this a strong start? Hmm...," Greetings Everyone,

I am 41 years old, and some would put my latest actions within the classification of a ‚Äòmidlife‚Äô crisis. I say this jokingly of course; I have recently had a freeing experience and shed a lot of what was pulling me down and minimized contact with a very negative person. When I say that things were weighing me down, I literally got to the point where I was slump-shouldered and spent most of my time frowning and looking down at the floor. Now that \*everything\* has changed, I find myself in the unique position of being way overweight (330+ lbs.) with a heck of a lot more time, as well as the resources to get back to where I was 15 years ago (around 225 lbs. with a respectable level of fitness and a decent physique). A note for those in your 20s; time goes by very quickly, and bad habits (and influences) can take their toll. Small, negative increments (such as a bit of ice cream and a beer on a semi-nightly basis), add up to huge setbacks. I am one of the lucky ones however; I lead a relatively pain-free life and I don‚Äôt have any major health problems (yet). 

I must admit that I am a ‚Äògear‚Äô person, so I bought a Garmin 945, metaphorically becoming ‚Äòthat guy with the $300 sneakers and the 10 cent squat‚Äô (if you know what I mean). I was attracted to Garmin because I am going to run a half marathon continuously in 9 months. I figure that 9 months is enough time to run a 5k continuously, then a 10k, then a half marathon of course. Next year I am going to run two marathons. Concurrently I am strength training once per week to avoid muscle wasting. 

I really enjoy Garmin connect because it takes the guesswork out of training for a race. I decided to start things out by starting on a training plan to run a 5k continuously on July 1st. When I started the training program, it asked me to complete a benchmark run, then formulated a workout plan for me. I had my first formal run (after the benchmark run) today and it was ABYSMAL. I expected this, however, but I didn‚Äôt know how bad it would actually be. I started off by telling myself just to get through it, and thought that I would at least be able to follow instructions and run 5 minutes and walk 3 minutes for 3 intervals (thereby running 15 minutes in total). It turns out that I was definitely wrong about that; I hobble-ran through the first 5 minutes, then I had to walk the rest of the way. I was experiencing some really horrible pain in my legs; especially my shins. Regardless, when I got back to the car, I felt better than I have felt in years. I actually remembered why I ran and went to the gym so long ago; it was to experience pain and hardship, then come out on the other side feeling absolutely elated (mentally and physically). 

I have a request from you if you have some time. Do you have any tips for someone who is starting out like I am? Also, how did you feel when you started your fitness journey? Thanks in advance for the advice.

39,"If anyone has had several attempts at C25k, just know that it can be done!","I just completed a 5k in week 9 of the NHS / BBC app. It is honestly such an amazing feeling to do something I‚Äôve never been able to do before. I have tried several times in the past and always gave up after a few weeks. Here is what I had to learn, maybe it might help someone else.

1. Don‚Äôt overthink runs. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the optimum time of day, weather, food for the day, running shoes etc are, the only important thing is to get out and do it. I am a classic over thinker so this was the biggest thing for me

2. It‚Äôs ok to redo days / weeks. This will lead to gradual progress not burning out and hating it leading to quitting.

3. Any day you got out and ran is a success. Even if you don‚Äôt go quickly or run very far.

4. If you miss a few runs, you haven‚Äôt failed. The next few runs may be harder (maybe redo a week) but you are not back to square one.

5. This subreddit is amazing, I loved looking through for inspiration and reassurance that I wasn‚Äôt the only one who finds it hard!

As such the pain is not unbearable - I feel like I can easily power through this, but I don't want to cause a major knee problem by ignoring it. I've received a bunch of varied advice from family and friends including

* Get better shoes 
* Rest for a few days, and don't run again until the pain goes away completely 
* If it's bearable, you're fine

58,Low energy levels and how to combat them?,"I'm currently redoing C25K for the second time (last time I did it in 2018, I then did a half marathon in 2019!!) as until recently I'd not run in over a year, but I was feeling lousy with staying at home, eating too much and not moving enough. 

One thing I am finding this time round though, is my energy levels are struggling, I think it's something to do with lockdown and only working like 8 - 12 hours a week because of being furloughed.

For example, today I did W3R2 in the morning (about 8am), got back in around 0830, had a shower and some breakfast (not at the same time) and then by 10am I had to go for a nap. This afternoon I'm working (from home) and I am struggling to stay awake.

The only thing different from last time, is that on my non-run days, I'm doing Ring Fit Adventure on my Nintendo Switch, which I usually play for about an hour, which results in about 20 minutes of active moving/working out, probably something like a 50:50 split of jogging on the spot and then various exercises on different areas of my body (I try and only use leg workouts when the game demands it, as I consider running every other day enough of a leg workout)

I sprinted at around 4.2 KM / min for 1 minuite before I slowed to a jog before halting- the entire run lasting 10 minutes, with prewalk-jog there, and then slowly revving up before the sprint-

Either I wouldn't finish or would take a lot of extra walking time it was really discouraging. I started missing days but I was still fairly consistent. I retried the first week over and over but I just couldn't do it. Now I'm back to training the 5k but suddenly this is harder too. I'm so much weaker mentally and I always need to walk where before I would never let myself.

69,A terrible training experience I had the other day,"I decided to start running as of recently due to my lack of cardio in my daily workout routine, so I decided to pick up a schedule. The first 10 minutes went smoothly but after about 15 minutes of running I felt a jolt of pain in my thigh. I sat down on the side of the road to take a look and I kid you not it was pulsating like crazy. I went to feel my leg and I recoiled quickly. My thighs were fucking smoldering, like the heat that comes from over a toaster. For some reason my legs themselves didn‚Äôt seem to be damaged. I grabbed a nearby stick and poked at the leg, and noticed it was rock solid. No man or god or otherworldly force could have caused this blasted thing to budge an inch. In the moment I felt so hopeless and terrified. So I was sitting on the side poking at this chunk of calcified flesh previously known as my thigh wondering what to do, and I tried to get up to call for help - no such luck. That thing was absurdly large and heavy. No going back now I figured. I had no phone to call for help from, so I waited an hour or so for my leg to cool down a bit and stop smoldering. Slowly, the flesh began to heal and lighten (both color and weight) which came as a relief. That night I went back home with legs far stronger than imagined thanks to this simple technique. Overall, I would highly recommend running as it allowed me to get insanely strong. Tomorrow I will begin weightlifting",C25K,1615234546,RemarkableRhombus,3,1,True,2021-03-08
71,Does it ever get easier lol?! W5D2 finished today,"I just finished W5D2 today (the 8 mins runs) and was okay and managed to finish both 8 mins runs without stopping but it was nowhere close to comfortable (no pain etc just very happy when I stopped lol, breathing was mostly okay, HR in the peak heart range by the end of both runs). I did get a bit out of breath by the end. To be honest, W5D3 scares me to death lol, I mean, how will I be able to do it if I struggle with W5D1-2?!
Maybe it's partly because I had more rest days than usual between this run and the last one - W5D1 was on Thursday last week, I also had a huge work exam last week - an almost 7 hour exam I've been prepping for months - and lot of alcohol and weed afterwards so there's a high (pun intended) chance that these few days of bad-eating-and-substances had a bit of an impact on my run today. I've been very disciplined with both eating, losing weight (I'm overweight so working on that!) and getting eating healthily for about 1.5 months now (minus those few celebratory-over-the-top days last week) and I don't normally/habitually smoke anything or drink.

I'm thinking of re-doing W4 and D1 and 2 of W5 because   I genuinely don't think I'm ready for the 20 mins straight run. Maybe it's all in my head only? Because I also realised that 80% of the battle during my runs is in my head. How do you push through it? And most importantly, please give me hope that it'll get easier with time and practice and patience and consistency because as far as I experience it, it only gets harder each week üòÇüòÇ",C25K,1615237477,No-Impact2868,2,1,True,2021-03-08

74,Just started - confused about duration of weeks one and two (15 vs 20 minutes),"TL;DR - For weeks one and two is the five minute warmup included in the ""for a total of 20 minutes"" or not?

Hi all,

I checked the FAQ and didn't see this, so sorry if this is covered territory and/or a stupid question.

I just attempted W1D1 and I think I misunderstood the program. When I read the plan, I interpreted the week one routine as being a five minute warmup followed by 20 minutes of run/walk loops, for a total of 25 minutes. Actually 30, since I read somewhere that there's an implied five minute cooldown.

I downloaded one of the ""podcasts"" to time me and I was surprised when it ended after the sixth run - meaning it was only 15 minutes of non warming/cooling exercise (13.5 really, since the last walk was part of the cooldown).

When I got home, I checked a couple other ""podcasts"" and they seem to be split about how many iterations they do - some do six, some do eight.

If its just 15 minutes plus warming/cooling, I'm a little disappointed in myself. After the fourth loop, I decided to just walk home and call this ""Week 0"" but I left the audio running. After skipping one iteration, I decided to do one more before calling it - one that the audio then informed me had been the last one. So I did W1D1 entirely except for one section! Had I realized how close I was, I could have just pushed through it!",C25K,1615242392,GkarMollari,10,1,True,2021-03-08

*Processing img higk9idanui61...*

I've been running... Just this simple fact is amazing enough in itself! And I've been running three days at week for 7 weeks now, which has totally renewed my relationship with the cold winter months by getting me outside and actually enjoy it. Lots. And so does the doggo!

Problem is just that though. I've been enjoying the process a lot, but since starting the 20+ minutes runs two or so weeks ago it seems like the pleasure has been slowly taken out of the runs. The mental barrier feels really real (heh!), and I've even started dealing with numb toes and slight discomfort. So here I am, wondering if this is just a fact of the runner's journey: that running is sometimes harder, especially for longer runs. Or if maybe my body is sending me a signal to take it easy for a few days or to integrate some interval training again to ease my mind into these longer sessions. 

I'm really curious to hear about your experience about being a few weeks, months or even years into running, and how you adapted to this new habit. Learning how to calm the mind and trust ourselves and when to know that we got to take a break/change the routine!

I started running after a period of some inactivity from sport (late 20s/early 30s) in the summer of last year since I'm off work due to the pandemic and had started to put on a few kgs, while still being fairly slim. 

I ran about 50 times over a three month period and went from being totally gassed to hitting the 5km mark several times, which I was really proud of, but a constant problem with one knee emerged which stopped me. I was waking up at night and it was sore and stuff, and it became more severe as time passed.

I've since had insoles made to somewhat correct my quirky gate and, at the advice of an orthotics specialist, laid off the running for a couple of months. 

However, I started back again today, running about 1 mile just to start with. My knee held up ok and, although far more tired after the run than I'd like to be, I felt fine, but I can obviously feel my knee a bit again now.

82,Burning calves during easy and recovery runs,"Hi to everyone,

recently during some easy runs my calves started to burn pretty soon. I feel like if I go faster my calves and my ankle would hurt less but I couldn't sustain the gait for long.
This happens only during recovery runs and easy runs, like I'm too heavy on my calves.

I usually run in the streets and of course it is not smooth. It presents road holes, sidewalks and bumps.

Anyway, as soon as I stop running the burning stops and my legs feel a little bit fatigued but nothing unusual.

Am I running wrong? Are the shoes not suitable?

95,Sore quads for almost two weeks - is this normal?,"Hey all, just looking to get some advice on some soreness I'm feeling in my quads. 

So two Saturdays ago (i.e. the 13th of February), I went for my first W5D3. I was able to get through it. However, the next day, I felt really sore, especially in my quads. Not surprising, I never ran that long before. I was thinking, as limited as my knowledge is, it might have been DOMS. I was quite consistent with the weeks before, and this is the first time I really felt lasting soreness in my quads.

Come the next week, the temperature was pretty hot since it's summer where I live. In combination with my sore quads, I decided to take a few days off.

The following Saturday (20th of February), I felt it was too long since my last run, so I decided to start W6 then. Not gonna lie, it went pretty awful, and I wasn't able to complete the last running interval. However, this was mainly due to the heat. That said, I still had sore quads and the pain, while mild, was consistent with each step and didn't really decrease at all. 

On Monday (22nd of February), I decided to redo W6D1. With the weather a lot cooler, I was able to complete it no problem. However, my quads haven't really improved, and by then it was more than a week since they started feeling sore. Much like the 20th of February, the pain was mild but consistent with each step. Running didn't really decrease the pain.

The pain hasn't inhibited my ability to run or do basic daily stuff, but it's definitely there. I'm concerned it's a sign of some mild injury.

Has anybody had a similar experience? What would you recommend I do? All help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!",C25K,1614251488,Xydos,14,3,True,2021-02-25

Healed, I decided to ease myself back into it by using my treadmill (prefer outdoors but this crazy weather we had in the US prevented that) and found that just taking that amount of time off really messed with my confidence and drive to even run for a few minutes!  I was so disappointed with myself. 

After wallowing in self-pity for a few days I decided that if the C25K app got me into running, perhaps it can get me out of this rut. So, I wrote down the days on a slip of paper, taped it next to the treadmill and have been knocking them off each day.

To continue on seems like the least sensible thing to do. I can't say I've gotten to the point where I enjoyed running. Which I'm not surprised by since running was never my thing, though the fact I didn't give up a lot earlier is a bit surprising. To keep bashing into this wall now is just not worth it.

Despite that I wouldn't say this was a complete waste of time. I'm undoubtedly fitter than I was when I started. However, it wasn't really the reason I was doing this. It was weight loss related and I don't feel I've seen it translate to the scale either, which is also a bit of a kicker.

33,"Week5 Run3 done: I now get the ""runners"".","All my life, running was torture. In PE class we did forest runs and as a chubby kid the huge dread before, the burning lungs and horrible stitch during and the awful feeling of overexertion afterwards is all I ever knew and associated with running.

  
I was dreading this first continuous run of the program today. No stops, no catching of breath, PE class flashbacks came to my mind of just wanting it to end. But I did it, and it was way better than I ever anticipated!   


The first 10 to 12 minutes were way easier than the ""long run"" of 3 minutes a few weeks ago, it felt like running was suddenly on easy mode. I still had to push myself the last few minutes, but it was all mental and not physical. It was almost as if my mind did not yet make peace with me being able to run for 20 minutes straight without being absolutely destroyed.   


As I walked home, something came to my mind: This is how running is supposed to feel!   
My whole life I thought runners were some kind of weird masochists that actually enjoyed everything hurting and not being able to breathe properly for minutes on end. For someone that only felt pain after the first 10 seconds of running it was just illogical to enjoy something like this. 

But now I get it: Running can be fun! Not in a ""pushing through it, it will feel great afterwards"" kind of way but just the act in itself, feeling your body move ""effortlessly"" (still am far away from this) at a comfortable level of exertion with a light breeze in your face.   


I realise that I may have had a especially good day and that this run is not easy for everyone. But if you are just starting out or are dreading this first continuous run as I was: You are and will be able to do it!

Hi guy‚Äôs,

I‚Äôm a Junior in high school running a 5:20 mile, 20:48 5k, and a 12:02 2 mile. 

I‚Äôll be writing my training plan for each week and my progress throughout my high school years. 

Background:

Freshman year of high school - I only did cross country and track but I actually never trained to run. I just tried it out because I wanted to make friends lol

Sophomore year of high school - I started running a bit but I never surpassed the 25 mile mark :/ 

Summer going into Junior year - I trained the whole summer with an outside coach who boosted up my mileage a bit and thought me the fundamentals of running.

Junior year - I was ready to have a great season but I sadly got injured. I had to go to a physical therapist for a few months until I got back into running. That lead me to miss my cross country season and now that I‚Äôm starting my track season I currently feel like it‚Äôs too late for me to break my pr.

So the reason why I‚Äôm starting this weekly mileage challenge was because of Chase Easterling and for my own sake. Chase has inspired me so much through YouTube and has given me hope to keep pushing! I‚Äôve also been bad at tracking my mileage and so I want this to help me see my progression as I increase my mileage. 

(I‚Äôll talk more about my injury, gear, goals, etc. in different posts)

But most importantly the point of me saying this is because I‚ÄôM BACKK!! Let‚Äôs start the grind and run again!!

For the past 3 runs, I‚Äôve ran 6km/session without stopping. My speed is around 5:15min/km which sounds ok. 
However, my watch shows me I‚Äôm in HR max zone 5 most of my run even when I don‚Äôt feel short of breath(175 to 190 bpm most of the run)

71,Need some guidance on how to get started,"I (24 M) had labyrinthitis in September which cause terrible vertigo and left me bedridden for months. Even before this happened, I was not in great shape, hadn't exercised for years. But after the vertigo, I've been pretty much bedridden. The labyrinthitis has cleared up, but now I feel faint with even a little bit of exertion. 

My heart rate while sitting down is in the 80s, and even a walk causes it to jump to 110s - 120s. I found this pretty alarming so I saw a cardiologist, and they said my heart is fine. 

Is it possible to recover from this? Is it possible to be so out of shape that causes the heart rate to jump up so high? I've been to a number of doctors to rule stuff out and none of them found anything that could cause me to feel faint. Could this just because I've been sedentary? 

I saw the couch to 5k program and even the first day sounds challenging to me. It's embarrassing but is there something easier than day 1 I could follow just to get started?",C25K,1613325290,floydandpink,3,1,True,2021-02-14

Wow, didn't realise how the speed of my weight loss decreased until I typed that out. However I understand that the initial weight loss was quick due to water weight and over indulging on Christmas and NYE.

A few things I've learnt along the way;

\- Running isn't as fun as I used to find it, even if I mix my routes up. Therefore I have decided to listen to podcasts related to my job. This helps me feel double productive and I really enjoy it.

\- Everybody is different, most people recommend to stick to the plan by the book. I have obviously gone through it quite quickly. This is only because I have been fortunate with time due to working from home and my legs/lungs haven't felt like giving way yet.

\- The break near the end due to icy conditions worried me, would my body regress? Of course it didn't regress that quickly and I was stupid to think so.

\- Mentally I feel much better for getting back into running.

\- A month ago I struggled with the 60 second run. Wow - I can now run 25 mins non stop! Along my running route (along a canal) that is enough to get me to the rural-urban fringe and experience some countryside!

I'm LOVING to be running again. I'm only up to W3, but I can already feel the pride that comes with being out on the trail. It's so great for the mind and body.

I was thinking that during the off days it might be a good idea to do the workouts that are two or three weeks behind you. That seems like a good way to keep the blood flowing, and we probably wouldn't be taxing ourselves too much. Of course I know that rest is as important as the runs, but wouldn't you think that almost constitutes a rest?

I did the calculations yesterday, if I maintain the same speed . I would complete a 5k run in 38 minutes. That seems far too high. Plus my speed is definitely going to slow down even more. So I think 40-42 minutes would be the fairly correct estimation.

I saw some advice that you should be closer to your BMI before running, however, I have NEVER been close to my BMI. In the past, I have focused on lifting and HIIT training, I believe my BMI ideal weight is about 140-150 lbs, and the lowest I've been is about 165 lbs. I just figure that in the past I've had a higher muscle mass. Recently I started walking just to get my body comfortable with outdoor training, so far I'm roughly walking about 45 mins - an hour, and \~4 km or \~2.49 miles, and my surrounding area is mountains and hills so the incline changes frequently. After walking at an average pace of 5.4 km/hr (or 3.36 mph) my shins are sore and usually feel fine the next day. From what I understand before you start running outside you want to start off slow.

I'm definitely feeling an improvement, but I'm wondering if my current strategy of running as much as I can straight is best for my current fitness level, or if I should be adopting one of the runs listed here which interspaces some rest walks (and warm-up walks, which I haven't been doing).

54,46F - C25K Redo - First full week,"About a week ago I posted about how I am restarting C25K 13 years after it turned me into a runner and 4 years after I let myself get overweight and out of shape.

This past week I finally got in 3 workouts.  My decision to stick with doing Week 1 Day 1 until I felt like it wasn't torture was a good one.

Workout 1 - 1.91 miles

Workout 2 - 1.87 miles

Workout 3 - 1.75 miles

The first workout felt great. I did all 8 run intervals and things felt well-greased, even though I felt slow and heavy (because I am slow and heavy).

But, during the second workout my lower back, I think the spinal erector muscles, got progressively tighter, which makes running less stable and slowed me down.

With the third workout my back started tightening up during the warm up walk.  I ended up aborting the 6th interval and skipping the last one just so I could even walk the rest of the workout.

Why is this happening?  Well, I am pretty sure it's because I have a weak back AND my weight.  I carry a lot of weight on my chest.  And, as overweight as I am I carry it on my middle, even though I tend to carry it relatively evenly (other than my massive chest).  That sounds confusing - I have a column shaped figure.  While I have a very large chest, even when not overweight, I tend to gain weight evenly on my body.  But, I am so overweight right now that I can't help but have a lot in the middle, too.

So, combining a weak back with being overweight...yeah, I think that's why my back is getting fatigued so fast.

I have to keep in mind that this was my first week doing 3 workouts and doing them relatively close together.  So, it was probably a lot due to my poor fitness.  The two weeks before I only did 2 workouts each week and they were spaced 4 days apart.

My next workout is Monday.  Another Week 1 Day 1.  Hopefully, my back/core will continue to get stronger with the workouts.  But, tomorrow, I plan to do some core exercises to help.

I'm currently in between W3 en W4, did the W3D3 run yesterday.

I am really dreading the jump from 3 min to 5 min next run... 

This is my second time going through the program. I try to run 3 times a week on a Finnish Slope (is it called that in English? It's like a track with woodchips for comfortable running), the one I use is the only place to run in my neighborhood because it's hilly everywhere else. Mind you, the track isn't completely flat, but it's doable.. 

So my question: what can I do about tight calves, they're starting to hurt more and more each run. Even during the 90 s run I did yesterday. I feel like in the 3 min run it eases up a little bit...

11,Motivation can be hard when it is just you...," I am an in my 40's mother of four who started C25k more than ten years ago in the midst of my career. I started because (don't ask me why the conversations came up) in one week in three separate conversations that, ""I am not a runner."" 

  
  It got to me, and I did something about it. I started C25k; I became a runner. I was running 5k's and my whole family got involved. It started to take a toll on my joints, then the injuries happened. I was back to the couch and was feeling my absolute worst.

     
  I bought a rebounder or a mini-trampoline for my smaller kids to use inside during quarantine for when the weather is bad...which has been most of the time. It started out with me just goofing around jumping on the thing as I was walking through the living room to put away laundry between online 1st grade school lessons. Then I started jumping on it a little more often for short intervals and I truly began to feel a little better. 

  
  I thought maybe I could make C25K work for me inside on the trampoline...and folks lemme say the sweat tells me it is working. I am running high knees on a rebounder for more than 30 minutes nonstop now. If your joints are killing you, get a rebounder. If I could run outside...I would. I am a clumsy fool on a treadmill. This is such a great alternative.   

  
  I've been looking for trampoline/rebounder fitness subs...but not found any that fit my needs. Then I came here. Watching your journeys has been amazing because I have been where a lot of you are...but I was really just needing a motivational workout buddy someone to run with. 

  
  I found this dude...running...live...on a treadmill... on RPAN...sweating his ass off. Just wanted to say if you are hitting a plateau... If you are struggling... if you need motivation... if you want to just cheer someone on... watch this guy... u/stevethepirate89 

  
  He runs most days, but not for the attention, not for the awards, or the up votes. He does it for him. He does it because he has goals. I just started watching him 11 days ago and yesterday was his 100th run. I started a subreddit for him because... I know I am not the only one who needs a running buddy. The sub is for anyone that wants to run with him or workout with him during his broadcast and they can share their progress and their goals. Check it out...trust me. You will WANT to run with him. You for sure won't be going it alone! 

  
  We all wanna do better, we want to be better, but you know, it's better when someone is cheering you on!!! We will start posting broadcast/running times soon!

12,Dad and Son attempt C25K,"Hello Everyone,

I've been a long time lurker on Reddit but the inspiration and motivation this subreddit has given me  forced me to make an account so that I could share our attempt at C25K; and so I can encourage others and hopefully provide others a little inspiration also.

I am 50 years old and my son is 12. I ran my last 5km run around 20 years ago. Since then I have become a below knee amputee and whilst I have learnt the mechanics of running with a prosthetic I have never run more than 100 meters with it.

Yesterday we successfully attempted W1D1 - it was actually easier than either of us thought. It was pretty hot (31c/88f) but we managed to get through it - although we had to encourage each other at certain points. Our satisfaction at finishing it lasted for hours afterwards. My partner was helping us with the timer so if anyone has recommendations for Android apps I would be most appreciative. 

The number 1 lesson we got from this subreddit was just to go slow and that any effort was better than no effort. We have both pulled up a little sore in the thighs today but nothing too bad. Can't wait for tomorrow's attempt and we will post how we go.

Thanks again for the motivation!

13,Advice for my fellow heavy runners,"Hey guys! I just wanted to provide some advice to y‚Äôall, that helped me go from 250+ pounds and unfit to 225 pounds, and running sub 19 minute 5Ks and a sub 6 minute mile INJURY FREE
 (definitely let me know if you don‚Äôt agree with anything I say)

1. Prioritize cross-training
- this is especially important for us heavy runners, because we need to minimize the immense stress on our joints, but still improve our aerobic fitness/strength 
-I recommend the classics for this: cycling, swimming, yoga, and strength training (full disclosure these are all the activities I did üòÉ)

2. Quicken stride rate/cadence
-the quicker your stride, while maintaining the same pace, the less absolute load your knee takes for each stride
-in fact I advocate for something close to something close to a quick shuffle, when first running, in order to minimize impact

3. Strengthen hamstrings and hip flexors
-these two muscles are the most neglected, if and when people decide to do strength training, even though they are probably the most essential for run speed, injury prevention, and load management
-hamstring exercises: hamstring curl/Nordic curl/slider hamstring curls
-hip flexor exercises: leg or knee raises (hanging or laying down) 

If you made it this far, then thank you!!! If you‚Äôre more interested in some advice for heavier runners specifically, check out my YouTube video on this topic

Wanted to share my journey a bit, hope this won't come off arrogant. I just feel like it's important to hear what the program really looks like in everyday life, not just the success stories.  
It took me about 18 weeks. Yes, that's right. So feel good about yourselves! After the first time I did W1 I had to rest for 3 weeks due to pains. Then I managed to get to around W6, but had to isolate at home for two weeks, and then I lost my mojo for two more. This brought me back down to week 3. From there I managed to keep going.

* This was the first thing I learnt: C25k doesn't guarantee running 5k in 8 weeks. It teaches you that you can absolutely, gradually get there, if you commit. It may take longer, that's very personal. But you can do it. 
* The 30 minutes thing wasn't working for me either, btw. With proper warmup, cool-down, shower? more like 90 minutes. Still, you can learn this habit.
* I tried to run 3 times each week, but for me it was difficult to keep days straight. So my workaround was to try to not have more than 2 rest days between each run; But you do you. Keep in mind that when the time between runs grows longer, you are more likely to slip out of the habit.
* Music was a super big motivator for me. I liked high paced rock (Weezer is beautiful for pushing forward).
* Good-enough gear is also important. Proper shoes, a nice armband for blasting music from your phone, running shorts. I didn't feel the need to go overboard, but I did have to buy some new stuff.

That's pretty much it... If you have any good tips how to transition to 10k, I'd love to hear it.  
Keep at it - you absolutely can do this. Find what works for you, and persevere. And if you feel down, come to this subreddit; People here will help you keep pushing.

Hey!

For context: Weak runner, hates any type of cardio. Literally just finished W1D1 a while ago (will be repeating it, though). Also attempted W1D1 about a month ago and Failed (had to stop before Run 3). It felt like I was gonna faint lol. I decided to stick with the program anyway.

I was doing W1D1 around an hour ago and by Run 3, I noticed that the front of my ankles (if that makes sense) hurt a little bit and felt kinda stiff. My knees felt like that too but the ankles even more so. I tried moving my ankles while running but it was so tiring that I couldn't stick to it.

I‚Äôve always despised any kind of physical activity and have always been ridiculously unfit. I started going to the gym a week ago and jogging on a treadmill. Honestly I surprised myself as I lasted a lot longer than I expected considering that last time I attempted running (god it must‚Äôve been waaay back during my high school years) I couldn‚Äôt do a minute straight whereas now that I‚Äôve lost some weight and probably improved my physique a bit with the daily walks, I was able to do around 5 without dying. After some research I figured that C25K would be a good place for me to start. Due to to covid restrictions gyms are now closed where I live and will be for at least 2 months now so I would need to run outdoors which I‚Äôve never attempted before. 
My biggest worry is that I sweat LOTS when exercising and I don‚Äôt know how I feel about the sweat/cold weather combo. Any tips on how not to get sick without going overboard with layers?

I graduated C25K about 5 years ago and it changed my life. Lost of ton of weight, got in great shape, ran marathons, etc...

However, after having kids I lost the time and energy to keep up with it and lost it all. Like seriously lost it all. Gained some (not all) of the weight back and lost all my cardio endurance.

So, I want to start running again now that the kids are older, but I live in a place where the snow is up to my knees and will be until March at least. So I need something indoors to start working on getting my cardio back.

Gyms are closed where I live due to the pandemic. I do have a home gym where I do powerlifting (that too, has fallen off unfortunately due to a major shoulder injury). I don't have a treadmill but I do have a spin bike.

I hate cycling, but I am willing to give the spin bike a try at least until the snow melts and I can run outside again.

**TLDR; I started C25K today to help benzo withdrawal and get my heart healthy!**

I've been recovering from benzodiazapines (prescribed) for quite awhile. And with them comes nasty nasty withdrawal symptoms and potentially life long issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the reason i want to do this is the fact that I'll be 30 this summer and i have been sedentary all my damn life. Partying, drugging, eating like shit. Just not taking care of myself. As i get older i can feel my heart just get weaker and weaker. I've been to the cardiologist and everything checks out but I'm just completely out of shape.   


I cant run. I could never run without just giving up because I'm one lazy bastard. 

&amp;#x200B;

My son is 3 and he requires so much energy, and i want to give that to him..I'm completely sober, off booze and everything. Down 30 lbs due to fasting but my strength and cardio are just a wreck. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, getting off benzodiazepines after 6 years has made my body not know how to regulate adrenaline and cortisol... or so that's my unofficial self diagnosis.. so yesterday i worked out with the little weights i have then meditated for 10 min and i was on cloud 9!!

&amp;#x200B;

All my adrenaline and panic was gone, i was able to sleep last night and my body just feels like its ready to keep moving! So i started C25K this morning and here just to kind of hold myself accountable and say hey!

It was only when I got the halfway notification from the app and my thinking wasn't ""I'm only halfway through"", but ""that's only 2 and a bit songs and I'm done"" that I felt that I could complete W5D3. And I did. Not going to win any awards for the pace, but it saw me through. I haven't really felt good about what I'm done in the last year or so around my health but this feels like it's...something. 

The snake story isn't all that interesting. I was crossing a bridge and a small snake (only around 50cm, no idea what it was) must have been hiding along the side I was jogging on and my stamping spooked it out. This ended up with both of us heading in the same direction along the bridge, but my size advantage meant I was getting closer to it. It definitely gave me a start and I came to a quick stop and sidestepped to the other side of the bridge in what I like to say was a tactical repositioning rather than a jump out of fear. Luckily it was just as eager to avoid me as I was it and it found a gap it could squeeze through on the side of the bridge and disappeared. Definitely could have done without that as while I know they are out there I'd rather not see them and if I do I'd like a respectful kilometre between us.",C25K,1608895130,Jay-lar,0,1,True,2020-12-25

49,I started C25K today and it felt AWESOME!!!,"I'm so excited about this right now!!  
I used to run, years ago, but never took it very seriously or had any real goals. My runs were mostly under 10min long before I had to give up.  


Now, thanks to this wonderful app and subreddit, I'm totally motivated to get through those 9 weeks and be able to run for 30mins straight in the end!! Love that idea and am super stoked right now!  


Went for W1D1 today and it felt soooo good!!  


Question though: It almost felt a little too easy today. I'm tempted to skip to Week 2 right away because today felt not too challenging. Did anyone else experience this?

85,Quick tip if you feel defeated after not being able to complete W1D1,"If you're like me and you have an office job you sit all day at work, sit all evening at home then lay in bed all night sleeping and get no exercise at all, it may feel like even W1D1 is impossible, at least that's what it felt like for me. After a few 60s jogs I was so out of breath I couldn't do any more at all and had to walk back home feeling like $hit.

What I found helped a lot was to do a sort of Week 0 type of thing, where I had the W1D1 podcast playing but I would just do the brisk walk for the whole duration and no jogging. I did this for every day for one week and it really helped with being able to not be so out of breath/in pain after a 30 min session. I kept it at roughly the same time each day (starting between 7pm and 7:30pm in my case). On your first day it feels pretty hard to do a constant brisk walk for a constant 30 mins without stopping, but after only half a week I could do the brisk walk non-stop for 30 mins without even any heavy breathing.

TL;DR: For 1 week, just walk for the whole 30 min session every day before starting W1D1.",C25K,1609101115,Baileyboy125,4,1,True,2020-12-27

72,W1D1 - Completed ( 6 months ago I came back home without completing after first 4 runs),"Hello Everyone,

I am writing to say few things to people who are afraid to start W1D1. A little bit of background about me. I started W1D1 6 months ago and came back home without completing it (just after 4 runs). I couldn't even complete 60 secs run intervals. and I stopped doing C25K feeling that I am out of shape / over weight to run. 

After going through many posts on reddit (a big thanks to reddit community) I got ""I can do it"" feeling. Today I did it. For the first time I ran with 4.3 to 4.6 Miles/hour speed (8 runs). That's a huge accomplishment for me who once was afraid to run. (I think I didn't run, it's slow jogging). While doing those intervals I didn't even think that I am that fast. I usually walk at 3 m/h average speed.

So, Here is a thing that helped me complete W1D1. Run as slow as you can. I literally did brisk walking with running posture ( taking help of my shoulders and hands to move a bit faster than walking). This helped me a lot. I am not out of breath and was able to cool down as soon as I started walking for 90 secs. A huge mistake I did 6 months ago is to run fast and loosing control over my breath.

I was wondering if there were others doing C25K on a treadmill? What are your best tips?

I also do some weight lifting after my treadmill run so I normally skip the cool down or limit it to a minute. Should I complete the 5 minute cool down? Will it be better if I ended my workout with the run?

I never ran in my life (31 years) before 2020. So, it‚Äôs all new to me. Any advice would be helpful.

77,Can we talk about shoes? How tight do you wear your shoes?,"Hello, I am close to the end of the program, and getting used to running for long interrupted periods of time.  I have a problem where no matter how tight my shoes are, I'm unhappy with them.  If they're too loose I think I am going to hurt my feet, but if they feel tight I also worry that I will hurt my feet.  Also, if one foot feels tighter than the other, I think about it my entire run. 

I used to always readjust my shoe tightness during the walking breaks, but now that there are no more, I don't want to stop running to fiddle with my shoes.  I also suspect this is a mental thing and I've just gotten hyperfocused on it. 

So, how tight do you wear your shoes? Does it bother you if they're not exactly the same? Can anyone relate? Advice?

81,I was scared I was going to have to stop running but I completed W3D1!,"After W2D3 my shins were hurting. The pain wasn't unbearable so I don't think I could call it shin splints but it was a little painful. I was extremely worried because I literally just started c25k and I didn't want to stop. Last time I tried c25k was 4 years ago and I stopped because I thought it was too hard and also I was extremely embarrassed to be seen running. even though I was running at night, there were always other people outside.

Anyway, I came to reddit and was browsing the running and c25k subreddits about shin pain and through that I actually came across the post that said you shouldn't be winded and I realized I've been running way too fast. It was kind of easy to run fast when you only had to run for 60 to 90 seconds. I wasn't sprinting but it was definitely too fast for me.

So yesterday night with a 3 day rest in between from w2d3 I decided to run really slowly. I also did some lower body stretches that I saw recommended to help prevent shin splints. But I think what really helped was running slowly because before that during my at home workout I tried to do fast feet and I immediately had to stop because my shins instantly yelped out in pain. at that moment I was debating if should I still go out after my workout to run but I did and I don't regret it. 

I'm not going to lie I was feeling very very very insecure about running slowly because I feel like people look at me as the fat girl, so they would think ""of course she's running slow""  but honestly it felt really good to run slow. It felt really good to run especially when the week before I was nervous about week three because of the three minute runs. Yesterday I ran without music too for the first time and the 3 minute runs really went by quickly at that pace and I'm excited to complete this week and move on to week 4.",C25K,1608163957,LavenderLilacFlower,3,1,True,2020-12-16
83,Finished!! Be Good to One Another.,"I finished the ""program"" and finally made it to a 5km run, straight through, no stopping, vomiting, dying, or falling over crying, etc. I completed this about 12 days ago and just haven't posted about it yet. I did it again the next day just to make sure I really did *could* do it and that it wasn't a fluke. I've now run 5km four times in about 10 days and got my time down to about 32min (and slowwwwly dropping). Yesterday I ran 6.5km straight and I am so freaking excited I don't even know how to explain it. 

There are a lot of end-of-program posts with advice, lessons learned, next steps, etc. I wanted to say something different while I have this small spotlight:

* Keep being good to eachother. One of the reasons I found and followed this subreddit, even before even *considering* joining or running, is because of the encouragement from one another and the constant motivation to BE BETTER. I liked seeing posts come up in my feed of people accomplishing something. And if there was a setback or inability to achieve that goal right away, someone would generally comment and offer advice or encouragement. You all are either making yourselves better or you are pushing others to do that for themselves. This is the Internet. Notorious for bullying, pettiness, and toxicity. This sub is different which is why I've lurked reddit for 7+ years and been most active in C25k.
* I want to thank u/possefarm for being my ""unofficial sponsor"". I know we don't really do that here but I saw this dude's posts again and again and again. At some point I kept seeing the progress, kept seeing that ""crazy smile"" and thought ""Why couldn't this be me??"" He did not even know it, but this guy was the initial spark for me to start running. Also big shoutout to u/rwhickok for being awesome, having a similarly inspiring slew of posts and for freaking making snow angels after runs. I'd love to call out about 20 other users who were in what I would consider the same ""class"" of the program and also posting and providing motivation, but I won't do that right now.

There are many others of you that I have seen your posts and felt inspired. If you'll allow me the soapbox one moment longer, I want to say that each and every one of you has the potential to inspire someone in your own sphere of influence to make a positive change in their lives. Even if you don't know it. The Internet is a big place and you never know who may be lurking or following your posts of self-improvement or your progress, whatever it may be. This goes outside of the Internet as well, obviously. So please keep that in mind - continue being good to one another and be good to yourselves! Please don't ever stop that. Thank you.

99,I just ran for 20 minutes straight ... and didn't even plan to!,"So today was supposed to be my rest day (I know, I know) between W5D2 and W5D3, and I fully intended to just do a nice brisk walk on the treadmill this morning. Halfway through my first 5 minutes, I thought ""You know, I feel pretty good, maybe I'll do W5D2 again, just because I can!"" So, at the end of the 5 minutes I started running. I ran for about 4 minutes, and then thought ... ""I STILL feel pretty good, I wonder if I can go for the full 20 minutes straight? I can always stop if I have to.""

But I didn't. I was listening to *The Subtle Knife* (thanks HBO) and just kept plodding along. I didn't want to stop, I didn't feel like I was going to die, I just ... did it, without even really meaning too. 

I'm so stoked! I've always hated running because I've always been terrible at it, and for the first time in my life I ran and enjoyed doing it.

2,W0D2 - Did I finally figure it out?,"I posted here the other day about finally taking the first step and walking after being sedentary basically my whole life. I took another walk last night. It was chilly and the sun was setting behind the mountains, but this time, it was windy and it was cutting through me. I thought, ""Well this won't be as fun but at least I'm walking"" and focused on my prize of hot tea. 

After a few more minutes, I was really feeling miserable in the wind, so I thought, ""Maybe ten seconds of jogging will warm me a bit."" As much as I want to be a runner, I've been very afraid because I only remember being miserable when running. I gave myself a pep talk: ""You can stop at any time, no big deal, just warm up a bit, no expectations,"" etc. 

So I started jogging, very slow, so slow I almost started going backwards lol. But ten seconds past, then twenty, then thirty, and I shit you not I got up to about 45 seconds before stopping. I have NEVER ran 45 seconds straight in my life. What was different? I was focused my BREATHING. I didn't let myself huff and puff. I focused on deep breaths. I did this short exercise video on YouTube the other day and they said after the work out to take deep breaths since that will get you more oxygen. So I did that and I wasn't miserable AT ALL. I did four or five more 30-60 second jogs during my walk. I don't know the exact distance, but I decided I would attempt to run the length of these train cars on the edge of my neighborhood, thinking it was a long shot. I DID IT NOT ONLY ONCE, BUT A SECOND TIME WHEN I CAME BACK AROUND.  The first time I finished it, when I went back to walking, I just started laughing because I couldn't believe it! 

Is the key to running the breathing?? How am I 31 and just now learning this? Wasn't a gym teacher in high school supposed to mention this at some point?

My doctor advised me to start running for both my physical and mental health (I have been dealing with mild depression for some months). I was not thrilled to say the least as I always dreaded running but decided to try anyways.
The first weeks (maybe 2nd and 3rd) felt like the hardest because it felt like running 5km at once was so out of reach. And then I got really surprised at how fast I could progress. A few weeks later, I managed to got the 5k on my first 28 minutes run (week 8 of the program).
I'm really happy about it and am now contemplating what's next for me as I know I need a plan to keep it up. I was thinking on keeping running 5km twice under the week and increase by 500m every week on Sundays. That would mean reaching 10k in about 2 months and a half.
Does that seem like a reasonable plan to you guys? Do you have any advice? If relevant, on the days I'm not running, I'm doing some 8 minutes workouts at home, focusing mostly on back strength (computer worker...) and legs/glutes.

10,Week 5 Working through this with Asthma,"So the first time I did C25K was about 10 years ago, and I did it all the way through the first time, and ran almost daily for a while, until repeated injuries kept me down and got me out of the habit.  Since my gym closed for good because of COVID (The only gym within a reasonable distance of me, being rural and all) I decided to start the C25K program again (at 46).

The problem is that my asthma is more of an issue now in my 40s than it was in my 30s.  So I was wondering how y'all deal with the runs starting from Week 5 onwards if you have asthma.

Note, I don't have issues with full on asthma attacks or anything, but I do get winded a lot faster than others, and while I can do the 8 minute runs, I'm now at W5D3 and the 20 minute one may simply not be possible.  

So the question is, do I just run as much as I can and stop for walk breaks as needed and call it good, or do I just keep repeating week 5 over and over until I CAN do it?  What do others with asthma or related breathing problems do when they hit this point?",C25K,1606150463,TheDreadPirateJeff,1,1,True,2020-11-23

Long term plan was to get a smart watch for more accurate tracking and not having to carry something in my hand! Anyway, finally got smartwatch and took it for a spin today. Had some more issues with tracking and the run restarting and it was very discouraging to mess with mid-run. Finally think I got it figured out but wasn't able to focus on RUN and do it straight through. Sporadic run went like this:
Warm up walk, jog for 5, app crash and walk for 2min, jog for 5min, app crash and walk for 2min, jog for 20min with a quick 30sec stop somewhere in the middle because I had some lower back cramps, cool down (nowhere near my starting point lol).

Not happy with saying ""I completed this"" - not a perfectionist but this one didn't go down well. Will take my rest day and get hardware figured out and give this one another shot. Feel like I was able to run enough to get it knocked out. You all keep being awesome!

97,100 days to sub-30 5k!,"Finally! I started c25k on August 18, ""graduated"" at week 5. I had run 5k but it was sooo hard. I didn't like running for 30+ minutes at a time.

6,Starting again,"Longish post.

So in March, I was in week 7 of my C25k progress when Covid cases rose up in my country. My mental health took a nose dive and I started feeling very anxious and couldnt sleep good. Eventually I stopped running and things became even worse. I had a panic attack in June which led to an ER visit. My doc gave me a beta blocker for day time and xanax to help me sleep. Two weeks after that were fuckin hell cause I was so afraid of having another panic attack. My HR during that attack was 160 and I had severe palpitations. I didnt like how beta blockers made me feel so I slowly lowered the dose and weaned off of them. But xanax was a whole another story. But I kicked it off as well last week. I have creeped out of a deep dark whole and beginning to feel like myself again. But these last months have shown me that I am mentally as weak as I thought I was. And no matter what happens, things are gonna be okay in the end. I now know that I can face stuff without losing my mind in the process. Meditation definitely helped and I have been doing it for last 3 months now.

23,Giving Back + Motivation,"Stopped and started C25k more times than I can count these last 5 years. Sitting at 164.1 Miles this year + first year completing C25k. New PR last night and wanted to offer some advice for success and motivation. 

Study the data - Apps provide insight about our habits. When we run and how often we run.  I use a watch to make things easier now but I did everything manually the first few years. Track when you run at a minimum. A simple ""X"" is all it takes. However, more data can provide more insights. 

Momentum matters, injury prevention was and still is my #1 roadblock to running consistently. I've gone from ""Is this something I can power through?"" to ""I can't walk, please carry me home"" in as little as 3-4 strides. After the first time I told myself it was a fluke and went on to do it again, and again, and again. And a few more times. Almost every time I made a mistake and tried to power through something I thought was minor I found myself taking longer to get back to running. Both from a physical and mental recovery standpoint. Now I stop when I feel pain below the waist. Full stop, nothing to think about. Make it a reflex.  I think many can relate to hurting on a run, especially starting out, everything hurts lol. But pain feels different, at least to me. I pay close attention to anything sharp in the feet, or calf muscles, hips and back. 

Less processed foods = easier runs and faster recovery. When I eat to fuel my runs I see better results. 5 years ago I was 210lbs and living on Monster and McDonalds. I've run fully on Keto. I've run only eating plant based foods. Lots of diets really. But no matter what your diet you can still run. What you eat can help break down walls.  Not only is it about how quickly you can recover but if you're trying to get healthier and need to lose weight to do it like I was every ounce that you can drop will make your runs that much easier. It'll hurts less and you feel better doing it. I think that first year I didn't have a single run that felt good. No runners high. No moments of triumph. I failed a ton. It all sucked.  I love it now, but man it took a while lol. 

Support goes a long way. My wife and I both run now. We don't always run on the same days or at the same time. But we both stayed committed to making it a regular habit and worked together with each other to find whatever stood in our way from making it happen. Every year we'd run a few times than we did the year prior. A little further. We made a commitment this year that we'd enter and run a 5k together before Covid and lockdown hit. We still have that goal and so we've just been getting our training 5k in ever other night 3 times a week until we get a chance to enter one and start chasing down those bigger distances and enjoy ""maintaining"" for a while. 

Find that small something that you can keep coming back to that reminds you why you wanted to start running in the first place and then get to it.  We'll be out here sticking to it.

53,How I lost a ton of weight with keto," 

How's it going,

My name is Thomas and I am new to the reddit community. I just wanted to reach out and let everyone know what helped me.

So 2 months ago I had a custom keto diet made for me and I am not kidding when I say it changed my life. I have lost 43LBS in 2 months.

Basically you give them some info about yourself and they create a custom keto diet plan based on your food preference, activity level, height, weight, gender, and weight loss goals.

[Here is a link to it](http://jacksoncashwellness.org/CustomKetoDiet)

It has helped me tremendously so I thought I would share it with you!

(also I would recommend you watch the video because it has some great info in it)

Good luck, I hope this helps you out. Keep me updated!",C25K,1605411109,ingamous,0,1,True,2020-11-14

32,"7-2 Completed, endgame is near","Just wanted to check back in as I'm nearing the end.  


When I first posted here I was finding the 5 min runs in wk 4 uncomfortable and afraid to hit a wall, and had been repeating weeks a ton out of caution.  But the unexplainable magic wand that is Week 5 has not abandoned me and I never did hit a wall or look back.  


After doing 5-3, I went straight on to wk6.  I had a problem on 6-2 because the temp shot back up to 85 degrees F and I was gassed and panting, re-did that one once, but then ran 6-3 in 40 degrees F and it was easy mode. Cold weather running has felt like easy-mode on both times when I was able to do it at sunset.  It seemed a touch harder today since I now have to run in the morning (dang clock change!), the cold morning air seems thinner than the evening air.   


I'm only doing 2 of these runs per week at this point, which would have me doing the final 30 minute run and then the practice 5K both on the week before Thanksgiving.  Assuming I do that last run Friday morning before Thanksgiving, should I break for 6 days before the Turkey Trot or do some kind of lighter run during that week?  


Going \~2.7 miles in 35 minutes including the 10 minutes of warmups and cooldowns probably means I could do a 5K in 35 minutes if I'd just run those last 5 minutes instead of cooldown during them, so I figure worst comes to worst by Thanksgiving I should certainly be able to finish the race.",C25K,1604532897,Cjwynes,0,1,True,2020-11-04

75,W3D3 done,"Haven't checked in for a minute but today completed W3D3! Day 1 of this week was rough, was hard to run for 3min straight the first time. Barely made it through. Took 2 days of break (also because I played racquetball in between) and then did W3D2 and that was even harder - barely made it through that one. So was feeling discouraged and a little scared of today's final run of Week 3. 
It wasn't bad at all! Think my tracking app was off because I did my same route all week and was .5mi less than the previous 2 days. Not sure what was up with that but I felt great, breathing was under control the whole time and I even flat out ran for the final 30 seconds of the last 3min run.

I have been jogging since my first couple of runs as that was the main advice from others on this sub - ""slow down"". Feel like that's paying off as I am seeing a difference, if only in my breathing and able to move on to the next run, but still that is progress and aligns with my goals.

I have my first ever running shoes coming tomorrow so I may or may not try those out for W4D1 - not sure if I need to break them in or what? Anyway that's all for now, keep it up everyone.

So, in my last post a few days ago, I had mentioned how I had completed W3 3 times already and could barely finish W3, so I could not get myself to go to W4.

Well, following all the advice I got: I took a break, I slowed down, I stopped feeling bad about myself, I breathed! And, I just got home after completing W4D1. To say it was easy would be a lie, BUT, to my surprise (but I'm sure no one else's), I completed it without any breaks!!! I ran for 3 mins and ran for 5 mins both times, albeit super slow. But, point is, I did it!!!

82,How do you stop yourself from quitting with faux tiredness such as boredom? How can keep motivated/disciplined to keep plodding along?,"I'm visually impaired which means I've never been legally allowed to drive which means that I'm used to walking everywhere. I can walk many miles with no issue and do so regularly, sometimes daily. I can happily do this listening to music or not while spacing out or making stupid conversations in my head. For whatever reason I've never found running interesting other than short distance sprinting such as 60-100m because it is over quickly. I got pretty quick at it as well when I was much younger. 

I have only managed to run over a mile maybe 5 times ever and that was on a treadmill. I'm pretty sure on those days it was because someone was talking to me at the time. I can't seem to get anywhere near that distance any more and it is much worse when running outside. I try to give myself goals like trying to reach the next lamppost or running until the end of the song or whatever, but I give up way to early pretending I'm tired. I seriously need to get a little fitter, lose some weight, and build up some cardiovascular endurance/efficiency so want to try running again over a longer distance, but every time I just stop with some psychosomatic pain, worry, or whatever. Today I had to go to my local pharmacy so thought I try jogging/running there. After about 50m I saw a bus coming so stopped it to jump on board. I wasn't in a rush or anything, just being lazy. I don't know what to do to get my head on right.

You're all really inspiring and I love seeing your photos everywhere (including in snow!). 

My question is about the difference between W5R2 and W5R3. So W5R3 is going to be 5 min walk, 20 min run (no walks!) and then 5 mins to finish. 

I'm looking at my app thinking there must be some kind of mistake! It seems like a big jump, from 8 mins running to 20 mind running without a break.

I'm actually fairly confident about this, because a few years ago I was dumb and did a 10k without training (not something to brag about, it just shows how crap I used to be at establishing routines), so I think 20 mins gentle jog will be okay.

33,Some encouragement for others who are slow to make progress,"Hey there everyone. I love how encouraging this community is, so I thought I would try to contribute something for others who, like me, may be going the long way 'round with C25k.

I'm currently in my third attempt at C25k over the course of many years. My first two attempts were brought to an end by injury (major plantar fasciitis and then stress fractures). This time around I was *exceptionally* careful: brand new running shoes selected after a professional fitting, a lot of time spent trying to prep my body for running again (with a trainer), extra rest days, a professional examination of my stride, and so on. I started back in March and made it through the first few weeks all right; I repeated weeks when I found myself struggling with my breathing, but I kept going. Then came the shin splints again.

Took three weeks off to rest and heal and got even more careful about getting enough rest between runs. Made it to day 1 of week 6 and just could not get it done no matter how many times I tried, even though I had done the 20 minute jog in week 5. Something just... broke. And no, I could not jog any slower!

At the recommendation of a coach, I switched to a program that has slightly less significant ""jumps"" in intervals than C25k, but has basically the same goal of getting you to jog for a certain length of time without having to stop. That helped for a few weeks, but eventually I hit another wall. I'm still at that wall right now, where I just can't quite make it through all of the intervals. But I also completed a charity (virtual) 5k via a combination of fast walking and jogging -- I jogged about half of it -- whereas last year I had to walk the whole thing.

The bottom line is: while I'm not where I hoped I would be, I'm still in a much better place than I was when I started, and I appreciate the support from this community as I try to keep going. I admit that it's sometimes difficult for me to read all of the success stories of people who seemed to start on a whim and blow through 10 weeks to run a 5k without missing a beat, but it's also inspiring.

I also suffer with endometriosis and PCOS. In the early weeks things would be so inflamed it would touch on my diaphragm and cause my whole shoulder and side to seize up. So. I slowed down and tried again. And again. And again. Each time the stitch took a little longer to show up, and then it would start to get a little less severe and suddenly I was maintaining pace for 20, 25, 30 minutes.

I know my shoes will give me blisters, but getting new shoes doesn‚Äôt necessarily fix the problem either, because without being able to break them in, they might also cause blisters. Do I spring for new shoes before the 5k anyway? Does anyone have any tricks to stop blisters from forming so I can run this last time in them and then have time to properly break in new shoes later?

4,Body problems during W5D3,"So I made it through 20 minutes of jogging, holy shit! Never thought I would be able to do that!

Buuut, jesus christ it was hard. I really had to push myself through the last minutes.

So the first 5-8 minutes of the run were kind of tough because when I started to run I just didn't have a good feeling, legs felt heavy and it was a bit difficult to get into the rythm. Also, for some reason when I do something straining for a longer time, my saliva gets like thick and it feels like my throat will get clogged if I don't cough it up and spit it out, and because of that I run and spit all the time lol which disturbs me a bit and makes it hard to get into a good breathing rythm. I also tend to get a runny nose which just makes it worse..

After the first 5-8 minutes it started to get better, I felt like I would actually be able to make it through the 20 minutes, it felt awesome. (This is also the part where my trail starts going a bit downhill so that probably has something to do with it lol)

A minute or so after the halfway notification though, my calves start to seriously burn. No pain, just that feeling of ""Man, we can't take this anymore!!"" which I guess is lactic acid build up? But yeah, they seriously started to burn and I started to doubt that I would ever finish this. Also I started having some mild stabbing pain in the left side of the torso. I had only 5 minutes left though so I figured I would just push through it.

The last 2 or 3 minutes or so my ankles started to really hurt though, never had that pain before when running so idk what that was all about. But I think it was because I took a path which was kind of offroad, with soft and a little muddy ground, so I could literally feel my ankles flexing so it was probably that.. My form really sucked the last 2-3 minutes but I just couldn't quit now. The last minute I also got a really sharp pain in the right side back of my torso which also persisted half a minute or so after my run was done.

So I did it, but what gives with these pains and bodily misfunctions? Any thoughts?",C25K,1602676692,arnoldGIS,8,1,True,2020-10-14
5,Frustrated with progress y'all,"Hey guys/gals.  Just want to vent a little and seek some advice.

Backstory - my wife has become a very active runner.  She's doing half marathons regularly and training for her first marathon.  It inspired me to get moving a bit myself, so I started c25k.  In the past year, I probably lost 35lbs or so just by watching what I eat a bit and doing intermittent fasting.  I figured running would only kick that into gear more.

As for my actually running progress, it has been all good.  I tend to repeat weeks when I feel I'm not finishing as strong as I can.  For example, I'm probably on week 6 in reality, but I have been bouncing between w3d3 and w4d1 because I want to finish them stronger.  I want to be done w4d1 and not feel like ass for the rest of the day, so I just do it over and over till I crush it.  Maybe that's no good...

Anyway, my real frustration is that I stepped on the ol' scale, and not only have I not lost weight, but I've actually gained a couple of pounds.  Super demoralizing.  I know all the things that I should be thinking like ""but you've made progress...you can run for 5 minutes straight now!"" or ""I bet your clothes fit better!"" or ""you've gained muscle""....but, it still sucks.  

So as of right now, what I end up doing is just running extra.  Instead of 3 days per week, I'm doing 4-5 minimum.  Eating just 2 meals per day, generally a lean cuisine for lunch, and then whatever we are having for dinner. Has been my meal plan for about 2 years now, but I guess that has to change and I have to get better at tracking what I eat. 

Anyway, this is mostly just an early morning vent.  Thanks for all the support and for continuing to post your progress.",C25K,1602680049,halupki,22,1,True,2020-10-14

I was anxious before hand, and didn‚Äôt want to go out in the ‚Äúcold‚Äù (it was not cold).  I went because I pushed off my night shower for after my run and I had a breakfast meant to fuel me for said run.

Normally I ‚Äúskip‚Äù warmup and start running until I‚Äôm tired and *then* start the intervals, but I found the 5 minute warmup to be relaxing and less pressure, so that helped with the anxiety.

First two 2 minute running intervals were hard, and I fell hard halfway through the first one.  ^(new) Phone case has a nice scratch and so does my hand and knees.  Nothing too bad, so I got up and kept going.

Last two were a lot easier.  Might of been due to runners high or just got in the zone.

23,"Finished W5, onto W6 &amp; amazed how it comes together","Just wanted to post an update, for various reasons I had been crawling through the early weeks repeating them multiple times rather than push myself, and my first W4 run had been an eye-opener in level of difficulty.  I really felt that was the first time I found a session unpleasant, and questioned whether I could keep advancing or hit a wall.

But less than a month later, I'm on Week 6 now, and started this week by doing the 20 minutes no-breaks run of W5D3.  (Wanted to have a full weekend's rest before trying that one rather than end on it.)  It was amazing how it suddenly clicked, that you can go from it feeling like a desperate slog to sustain a jogging pace for 3 minutes to doing it for 20.  I'm not looking down at the phone to see how much time is left anymore, I'm just doing it until the voice tells me to stop, because thanks to the 20 minute run I know I can do anything less than that easy, and that was really surprising.

Sure the pace is still abysmal, but I think I could definitely jog one of the thanksgiving Turkey Trot 5k's this year.  
I think the key for me sticking with this will be getting some cold-weather running gear and keeping it up through the winter.

Second run back was a little better but I still had to walk for a bit about halfway through a 25 minute run.

I wanted to share that the Nike Run Club, a training program, has been fantastic for helping me to stay motivated and improve my speed post-C25K. I kept getting/seeing recommendations for it and found its guided runs in particular to be super helpful in getting through runs. You essentially choose the run that works for you (e.g. ""20 minute run"") and then a coach talks in your ear every so often to remind you that you're amazing, that you should slow down, that you got this, random fun facts, etc. There are also speed training runs in which you do intervals to improve speed (again with the coach in your ear telling you how great you're doing). You can also set weekly/monthly goals, etc. if that's something you'd find motivational.

The shortest run you can do is 20 minutes, which is why this is probably best for those who are at W5D3 or more.

48,W2D1 Lessons learned running: omg it's actually working,"I honestly wasn't sure if I was ready for week two. I thought that going from 1 minute runs to 90 seconds runs would be super difficult, but...it wasn't? I think it was actually easier than W1D1?  Like what? What is this magic?

I gave myself a break of two days, because my shins hurt last time I went running, and I was worried that would effect me, but it didn't!


Now I only wish my muscles would grow as fast as my overall stamina. I did notice today that I recover much faster. My breathing and my heartbeat calm down much quicker than before.

So lesson learned today: It works! Don't be scared of Week 2! You got this.

51,W7D3 complete. Although I'm slow...,"Hi,

Today I completed W7D3. I tried to run at a speed of 7km/h but I failed to keep that pace after 12.5 minutes. Overall, I ran at a pace of 6.7 km/h 2.85 km in total.

What's good is I have no doubt I can complete a 30 min run in 2 more weeks. But I'm not so sure if I can complete a 5k in that 30 minutes. It may be more like 3-3.5 km 

Anyways, I'm doing this for health, so I don't mind if it takes a bit more time to pick up speed or distance. 

At least I started to consider myself a runner. Now I am working on speed/distance goals ;)

53,Was so worried starting C25K a couple weeks ago,"Today I completed week 3 day 2! It rained so hard starting when I was 10 minutes into the session, and I loved every second of it [:D](https://imgur.com/a/frY8ek9)  

I was worried about progressing through C25K when I first started, worried I would lose my motivation and give up as I had already done twice before!
I was struggling a bit with my breathing, even though I was counting in and out with each step (4 in 4 out or 3 in 3 out, which would eventually turn into struggling with 2 breaths in 2 breaths out). 

Last week I was browsing this sub and read the best advice ""slow down"". I took that advice and slowed down my jogging pace, telling myself its not a race, I don't need to push myself to make it slightly further with each run - I just need to be able to complete each jogging session without stopping! The past 3 runs I've been able to do just that - all because I slowed down. Before I was finding myself stopping at least 5-10 seconds early for the jogging portions.

I've also been adding one extra day onto the week before progressing onto the next, just to be sure that I'm ready to move on. I was getting nervous thinking about having to move onto week 4 next week, but you know what? I'm honestly excited for it!",C25K,1602873902,321789456123987,2,1,True,2020-10-16

55,C25k coucher here and i made a running app,"Hi everyone 3 years ago i was a potato couch before i found this sub. I decided to give it a try and i coudnt even finish the first 1 minute run. i fully commited to the program and almost 8 weeks later i was running 15km per week quited smoking and built some muscle you can find my early c25k posts in my profile. Having a math backgroung i was fascinated on all the data a runner can use in his training from begiener to pro. Last year i started programming and as a learning project i started building a web app which calculates running statistics and your aerobic fitness. This and some other scientific projects got me accepted in a master's degree which i just started.

i decided to deploy my web app for ordinary people to use it as maintaining and own a project will help me learn more about my trade. 

&gt;**Some things about my app**

&amp;#x200B;

    1) It supports strava api which means you can just sync your activities from strava
    2) it's mobile responsive: this means that althought is a web app and not an android or ios app you the experience using it from your phone is quite good
    3)It calculates your vo2max, your fatigue levels and depending on your last runs and this metrics it can create a running program for the next week( this feature is in a basic level right now)
    4) Calculates your running paces for every heart rate zone and your 5k,10k,21k,42k readiness
    5) it features the classic fitness-fatigue-form curve like strava premium and training peaks.
    6) all the passwords are encrypted and stored hashed on the database so no safety problem there and your strava credentials are authorized by strava itself so no safety issue there either

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Some other things**

    1) It is in an early stage: althought most of the functionality is working, the user experience might not be perfect, some buttons dont have functionality yet and bugs is inevitable to appear.
    so be patient while using the app, and report back any problem
    2) This is my first ever app so a lot of things might go wrong and it is a scary step for me but fascinating
    3) it's free 
    4) the app is in a small server which i don't really know how much traffic it can't handle so if the experience starts to get slow i would like to let me know to upgrade the server
    5) changes in the database might occur. That means that data might be lost. If you import your data from strava you won't have a problem as with a few clicks your data will be back from strava. If you choose to manualy import data make your to export your data frequently so you have a backup which you can upload again with 2 clicks on the new database. Nevertheless any update on the database will be made in the best possible way so data won't get lost

so if anyone wants to use my app and help me in the process by testing it and leaving some feedback you can find my app in

 [https://leadingpace.netlify.app](https://leadingpace.netlify.app).

use 

username : test 

password: 12345678

to load some dummy data ( please don't mess with the test profile so other people can see it too)

 i made an email just for the app so i would really love to get some feedback either on **this post** or in the following email

71,W7 Extra: HIIT Stairs workout.,"Today I did some extra workout. I went to do a HIIT stairs workout. 

There is these stairs in between two streets nearby. I think it is similar to 4 floors of stairs in a building, but outside in open air. 

So I went there and did 5 sets of ""stair run"". Meaning I run up the stairs as fast as I can. I sit down and catch my breath when I'm up. Then I go down and do it again. 

The whole workout took 12 minutes or so. 

Over time I intend to do it for 25-30 minutes, and maybe 10 sets of stair runs. Maybe add 1 set a week or so.  

I am hoping this will help with my speed, and strength of my legs. 

Tomorrow I plan to do a 5km walk in one hour (or less) for endurance. 

So my schedule is like:

Mon-Wed-Fri:C25K workouts.

Sat: HIIT stairs

Tue-Thu-Sun: Walk 5k's (in an hour or less).

It's along the outside edge and under the little toe are under my right foot mainly but it happens in both. I massage my feet and roll them on some lacross balls but it doesn't really seem to help a whole lot.

The pain only lasts during my running session but it's been pretty discouraging and I'm not sure what to do. I'm 5'10 and weight about 240-250. I don't have flat feet but do have pretty low arches. I was wearing insoles but took them out to try and see if it helped the pain at all but I haven't noticed much of a difference.

90,"W1D1 Finally, Intro, and Thank You","Shout-out to my unofficial sponsor [possefarm](https://www.reddit.com/user/possefarm/) who posted about their start on c25k. I've followed and subscribed to the subreddit for a while as I generally try to get positive stuff in my feed when I can, give some upvotes to people trying to better themselves, see the good in the world, etc. but I never pushed myself to participate. Saw possefarm's recent post and early W1 success and just related a lot to the post and felt like he and I had similarities and it really inspired me to get started. Thank you ALL for the good goals you are reaching towards and the encouragement you are providing to random strangers. This is truly amazing to see.

I'm not super out of shape but covid messed up a lot of my exercise routine and any fitness that I once had. Weekly basketball games with a group of guys was my go-to and haven't done those since Feb. I haven't run outside in a long time and have recently been feeling sluggish and gaining out-of-normalcy-type-weight and thinking things like ""How and why would I ever want to run? Running sucks. Exercise sucks. I'll just stay at home and play computer games and be with my family."" I can feel my health getting worse and in embarrassing and noticeable ways. That all has to change and I am going to at least use this format for some routine, guidance, and motivation. 

I don't know how quick or consistent I will be or even if I will finish the c25k training officially. I am at this point simply committing to running as often as I can and pushing myself to keep up with the c25k application suggestions. My timing could absolutely NOT be worse as I am starting school again full time next week, JUST brought our newborn baby home from the hospital, and we are heading into shorter days and suckier weather.

All these excuses aside, I will be running again and joining you all in attempting to better myself. I completed the W1D1 run today. 30min and 1.65mi. I'm not proud that I was struggling by the time run 6/8 came up or that I absolutely felt like I couldn't push myself further if I had to (thankful that it ended where it did), but I am proud that I can at least start at the starting place, finish W1D1 with only feeling slightly like I'm going to die, and hopefully go from there. I'll continue running and trying to actually participate in the sub when I can. Just wanted to say thank you all for doing this and wanted to let you know I am doing it with you. 

TL:DR: TY all, TY possefarm, my timing sucks but I'm gonna try my best, I started the first step

C25k is the single best app and I can‚Äôt believe it was free. I promise you guys I thought I was going to give up after my seventh run but just keep going. It‚Äôs okay to repeat runs or even not finish them in their entirety. Just be consistent and you will improve. Ahhh I love this so much I wish I could hug this app lol.

Now W4 is at the door, and it's kicking me in the shins... The first 3 minutes were fine, and I (barely) managed to finish the first 5 minute run, but it feels tough that I'm both increasing the time of runs and simultaneously halving my recovery walk time. I'm sure my being overweight is a factor as well (1m81 116kg).
At the start of the 2nd 3 minute run my shins felt like a steel plate, completely immobile and weighing me down. I decided to walk the rest of the run but the first few minutes of that were almost limping, trying to stretch everything out a little.

Ill try again in two days, haven't lost hope, but it feels like running into a brick wall. Guess I kind of needed to vent. Thanks for reading.",C25K,1601999932,RomanIdiot,2,1,True,2020-10-06

I am not making an excuse, but i felt like crap, and i was not used to ruinning outside, however after a bit, I got the courage to start again. And I stopped. So after a couple months I started again... And stopped again. I was so conscious about myself that I hated running outside. I felt people were looking at me (they probably weren't), and they were laughing at me (they probably weren't). So I took the plunge, and thanks to local buy and sell groups, I got a second hand running machine. I started back again, and hopefully I can worl myself back up to w4 - and further. I hope I get to the point where i feel comfortable running outside again - even if it's just the w1 runs outside. My goal is to do a park run (obviously when covid allows them to restart), so at the moment my goal is to build that confidence level up, and then work on the rest.

From those who have a bit more experience than me; do you think it is doable for me to train for a 10k by April next year? (Also taking into account the fact that, for the time being, I am repeating C25k runs). Or should I enter for the 5k to be safe?

60,Intense sweating - newbie,"Hi all. Running has always been a thing I'd love to start and I know I would get a lot of it (surviving a marathon is even one of my lifelong goals). However, there's one thing which has always been my put off - sweat. I'm not talking about a natural level. After running a few minutes I look like I'm straight after a shower.

I'm M28, 87 kg, 179cm. I train twice a week on a gym, the problem exists there too. I assess that if I lose my fat to get to a skinny level, I'd end at 65 kg. I'm very weak in every part but my legs (retinacula injury prevention).

Before the whole lockdown (say in March) I was able to run on my comfortable speed which was 9.5km/h. I was able to speak at the same time without much issues. However, after 5 minutes I felt like every single part of my body is generating water which felt both disgusting and extremely uncomfortable.

I know that the simple solution is to lose weight so my body would have to work with less fat (easier to keep a steady temperature). However, getting steady cardio is quite hard with my problem. Is there something which could help me not look like I'm about to die in a minute after short run?

Lack of stamina is obviously an issue I'm aware of. However, it's the water issue which prevents me from running and building my stamina level.

64,Running Shoe Recommendations,"Hello all! I haven't posted in here but I visit daily for inspiration. 
I just completed W5D2 and I'm super excited to say that I didn't die during the 2nd 8 min run! Lol 
I started C25K in June and completed up to W4D3 but took a break for a while due to various reasons. 
One of the main reasons was knee pain. 
I started body weight exercises in August and I've completed Chloe Ting's 2020 Summer Shred 4 Week Challenge twice and just started a Flat Tummy Challenge. I restarted C25Kast week at W4D1 and then skipped to W5D1 since I found it relatively easy.
My BMI is classified as obese (F 5'9"" 220lbs) but I know I've built muscle under my fat over these last 2 months. I feel that the muscle I have built has definitely made it easier to run. However, since restarting running, I've been experiencing some knee pain again. I know my weight is a big factor and I'm working on losing but I really don't want to stop running - I'm addicted to it and I never thought I'd say that!
So all of that preamble was to ask for running shoe recommendations. I'm currently using some New Balance shoes that are heavy and have a wide base for stability as these were bought when I was working at a theme park standing/walking all day long. 
I was told ASICS, Puma and New Balance are good brands but I don't know if there's a specific shoe recommended for me as an overweight/obese female that would help prevent knee pain.

I did the entirety of the program with my boyfriend, he's been a runner before but hasn't really ran in years.  I know I  was slowing him down but never once did he tell me that I was or that I was holding him back.  Honestly the most encouraging partner I could ever ask for, motivating me to push past my comfort zone without overdoing it. I was so scared to try to do a run on my own as I struggle with the mental game and have to myself continuously to not quit.  However, yesterday was the last run of the program and we decided to go separately.  I was terrified and convinced that I'd just end up stopping mid run without him as my motivation.  But guess what? I did it and actually decided to run an extra 2 minutes at the end.  I kept telling myself that I'd let myself stop running when I hit certain points of my route, but I'd get to that point and say to myself ""Well, I got this far, just as well to run to that next stop sign.""

My pace will only improve and i'm just going to keep trying until I hit that 5k.   I never thought that I would say this, but I think I'll keep training and try to hit that 10K eventually.  

This sub has been so encouraging for me; it's a breath of fresh air seeing a subreddit that is almost entirely positive and uplifting post/comments.   Just want to thank everyone and I hope everyone gets out there and enjoys their run today !",C25K,1601040801,MissMooo,2,1,True,2020-09-25
17,"For the first time in my life, I ran 5k! You can do it too!","I‚Äôm 27f. Throughout my life I‚Äôve generally been active. Maybe not hitting the gym, but I walk lots and eat well. One thing I always hated was running! I thought running was the devil, and I could never understand why someone would put themselves through that misery for pleasure?! 

Well today I‚Äôm a changed human being! 

A few months ago, some friends were talking about training for a half marathon. This got me thinking, maybe it‚Äôs time I give this running malarkey a try. So I downloaded C25K and made a start (I was not/am not aiming for a half marathon just yet, baby steps). 

3 things I learnt from this program which has made me go from a running hater to a running lover:

1. Slowwwww slowwwwwwww. Yes! Slow is the key word. As beginners we always think we need to be going at it hard, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs miserable. Once you learn to take it slow and steady that‚Äôs when the fun begins. 

2. Rest is important. The first 2 weeks of the plan I was running nearly everyday. I wanted to progress quickly but this was a big mistake. I injured myself and had to take 2 weeks off for recovery. There‚Äôs nothing worse than going on a run and having to turn round 500m in because you can‚Äôt walk. Rest days are important. They heal you. 

3. As beginner runners we worry about not ‚Äòbeing good enough‚Äô or thinking that others thing we are too slow or aren‚Äôt running ‚Äòproperly‚Äô if we walk parts of it. Well this is all lies! The running community is amazing. Everyone is so encouraging and supportive. No one is thinking about you and your run, they are too busy thinking about themselves. One tip is, if you cross a runner when you are running give them a wave or say hello. It will make you feel like a part of a team! I also say hello or good morning to others I come across. It brightens everyone‚Äôs day. We need that in 2020. 

I am officially mid way through W5 of C25K, but I decided to challenge myself to the whole 5k without stopping. I took it super slow and easy. Finished in 36 minutes. I‚Äôm proud of myself for finally getting there, and for becoming a running lover not a hater. 

I encourage anyone who is starting C25K or in the middle to keep going! You can do it!! And you can enjoy it, every step of the way. 

Have a great day everyone!",C25K,1601044003,sc2763,3,1,True,2020-09-25

24,Should I do the whole programme over again?,"I completed the C25K programme on June 19th. I kept up with running for a few weeks and then gradually started going out less and less. 

The last time I went for a run was just over a month ago and I ended up stopping and walking back home after 1.3K.

Even when I was running regularly my pace wasn‚Äôt very good and I felt as though I would never be able to run any faster. It was around 8 minutes per kilometre at best. 

I‚Äôm wondering if I should start all over again and try to work on my speed as well as getting used to running again? Or if there is something else I should do.

When I have tried running in the past, I have usually developed a sore knee and have to stop for a week or more before it comes right. Obviously this is a massive demotivation, hence I haven't really run for more than 3 week stretches before. People say you shouldn't fight through knee pain so I don't. 

Any thoughts on why I get this pain and how to prevent it would be appreciated. I think it might be related to my IT band, as there is usually pain in my hip also.

I am generally in good health, but have an average amount of fat (within healthy BMI range). The main problem I have is my posture. I have anterior pelvic tilt, which may stem from/be the cause of kyphosis and knock knee. To combat this, I am working on my glute strength, but I wonder  if there are things I can do while running that would be useful.

I bought a garmin forerunner 45 to track my runs, which so far I absolutely love and set out today for week 3, day 1. I thought it would be a struggle but it was by far my easiest run yet. I slowed my pace right down to around 6min/km as I hadn't realised how fast I must have been running before and what a difference! Finished with loads left in the tank. 

Takeaway from this is anyone who is struggling, slow down. I can run 3 mins at 6min/km and feel fine and hold a conversation but speed that pace up by 30secs and i am burst and gasping for air.

Did you finish a run that you have been worried about? - GREAT PROGRESS

74,Doing c25k at a slower advancement,"Hi,  
I hadn't run since 2005 due to a leg injury, and my only cardio the past decade was 4mph speed walks a few times a week.  So I started this at the end of May and have been creeeeeeeeeeping through it.  I think I spent almost 3 months doing the W1 routine, a month on W2, and three weeks on W3.  I phased up to W4D1 this morning, and was honestly pretty impressed that I could do 5 minutes straight jogging twice (pace was obviously awful, but I'm viewing ANY jogging pace as endurance building at this point.)  
I'm wondering if anyone else went through it slower like this as a noobie, and if or when they had to start doing any kind of ""real jogger"" habits to get past a wall.  5-2 and 5-3 look like a \*serious\* step-up from everything before them.  Should I be eating or drinking anything in particular before starting a run?  At the moment I just have a granola bar beforehand and carry zero-cal sports drink with me.

The run was moderately hard, but it felt good to complete it. In my previous tries of C25K I usually give up somewhere in weeks 4 to 5. 

Week 5 still scares me, since W5D3 has a 20 minute continuous run. But this time I decided to walk if I have to, or repeat the week if I have to, but not give up. 

I consider running 5k in 30 minutes a baseline of cardiovascular health, so I need to achieve this before I move on to any more intense workouts. Seriously, more advanced athletes do a run like this as a warm-up...

91,Which version of the program do you all use?,"I started the version that was included with Samsung Health (or, on their programs page, at least). It has a ton of walking long distances and not much running until 6-7 sessions before the end. My question to you all since I see so many people actually running in the early weeks of the program, which version are you using? 

I finally thought to look to see if there was a C25K app and lo and behold, there was. That one has the person running interspersed with walking from day one. Way better than, 'fast walking' (not even jogging) for weeks on end. 

The Samsung version felt like they expected a lot out of a person from out of the gate. I hit my ceiling at W6D3 because the muscles running up the sides of my legs from my ankles (not sure of the name) were just wrecked by the end. I used to power walk a lot more often and never experienced that issue. Even when I was running and playing soccer in school did I ever have that issue. I took a week off to give those muscles a break, but in also looking for exercises that strengthen those muscles as well. 

Ultimately, im looking for a lottle guidance to start from scratch a better way this time. Admittedly, I jumped into the program without knowing much beforehand, but I did know enough to stretch and hydrate regularly thanks to my sports background. I just figured since it said beginner that it would take much to jump in lol. 

How can I be more successful this second time around? What are some good exercise programs to supplement C25K so I don't hit that wall again?

7,Well this doesn't feel at all familiar!,"So I'm back running C25K, just did W1D2 to be specific.

After an ankle injury in early June I've not run more than a couple of km till now. I did try and restart gently but pulled up with severe pain after a couple of runs. Between a spring baby and lockdown blues I hadn't run consistently for months before that (was just getting back into the swing of things in June). 

Fast forward another 6 weeks off and after some advice from a firendly physio I'm back at it, though this time I'm easing in very gently and planning on doing the full C25K program before gradually increasing back to my earlier levels.

It's hard not to draw comparisons to my previous C25K experience nearly 3 years ago. This time I feel much fitter, stronger and healthier, despite being the wrong side of 40. No puffing and blowing and wondering what I was doing this to myself for. My first W1D2 was at 6am on a wet morning because I didn't want to run near people, today was a sunny run in the park where I met some of my neighbours - people I know through my local parkrun whom I likely never would have met otherwise.

What's the point of my rambling post you ask? Just this - C25K can change your life for the better. Probably not in a dramatic lightning bolt way, but in lots of little ways you'll hardly even realise until you're forced to stop for months.

I noticed my heartrate was about 10 bpm higher on hills compared to flat environments.

I probably should deal with these hills by running WAAY slower, but there's a lot more people where I am now. So I automatically run at regular speed, because I'm afraid to go at a slower speed to make it easier for myself.

I have a hard time running slow mentally because I'm afraid of people judging me and thinking I'm bad or something.

Like i mentioned in one of my comments, I injured my knee mid W2 and had to take a break which went on for a month.

Came back re did W2 ( D1 was horrible and honestly I was almost dead by the end ). Finished W2 with white a good mood but then I checked what W3 had in store for me.

Boy what can I say, little background on my body - I have not run more than a minute max on my own free will for about 6 years now and looking at that 3 minutes of continuous running I gave up.

The day finally comes where I have to run, I had not even set my alarm since I knew I won't be able to make it. But for some reason all this running my body woke itself up at 5am, I got up and my mind did everything it could saying I would not be able to do it and that I would regret starting the run (I also have exercise asthama plus being overweight don't help either).

By around 5:40am I started browsing Google with ""C24K W3D1"" and read a few posts, most being about how hard it was but then reading comments saying you did it and all, honestly that was the point where I said f*ck it, changed and went out.

For the actual run the first 90 seconds were easy enough then came 3 minute run and kid you not I started running and did not even feel tiered at he end of 3 minutes so continued for 30more seconds and repeated the same for last 3 minute run and was better off at the end compared to my W2D1 run.

So in conclusion of anyone here is putting of this big jump week I would say honestly if I was able to do it no problem it should be way easier for you, so stop putting it off and just go out and see what happenes.

86,"After swimming breathing is fine, it's the legs.","Hej,

I've never been fit nor really unfit. Dog walks and cycles keep things from standing still. Growing up in the Netherlands 10k bike commute to get to school was normal. But never have I been a runner.
When running I would always get out of breath.
A year ago a picked up swimming again and now can do a comfy 2k crawl slow and steady. I feel it really has helped with my endurance.
Naturally the out of breath moment would be a thing to slow down when  running. This warning system has gone.

Earlier this year I've rolled my ankle badly (mountain hike done, when almost at the parking lot...)

After a while when swim kicks were to painful, I started with the c25k program and used the initial weeks to help me recover. Fast walks, slow walks before starting to jog later down the line. With some minimal taping of the ankle and some good shoes. I holds up quite well during the later weeks in the program.

The dog is loving the runs.

I'm starting to love it too and have to restrain from skipping the rest day.
I'm natural toe walker (short Achilles tendon).
My ankle still on off days has a dull ache when just standing for example. I'm not sure if the jogging is helping or damaging things.
Three weeks ago I had a calf strain (tennis leg) and since then have switched from midfoot running to heel.

I've been managing the dull legpain and 5k barrier is still a limit that has not been crossed.

I feel great during the runs, and am happily surprised how well it is going. I want to keep doing this for a long time to come. Should I pause the program? Do more exercises regarding leg strength? I'm stretching in the morning and after a run.

Is the key to keep a 2 day rest in-between? Or should I do shorter runs? Any wisdom to be shared.

2. Did my route the other way around to not give myself an uphill run the last few minutes. Felt way better mentally do know that the last kilometer is flat (then I kept going, but still).

47,Adding jump rope to the program?,"5'10 / 200 LB / Female

I'm looking to go from couch potato to Muay Thai practitioner. Long time dream, time to quit making excuses. 

I've been walking 30 minutes a day each day for the past 3 weeks until I found this program, I've stopped breaking a sweat on the walks and I feel I'm ready to start incorporating running. 

For efficiency's sake, I'd like to start training my body for MT alongside my cardio goals, and most MT training could be done on rest days as there is plenty to do that isn't lower body, however, a crucial part of MT training is jump rope, preferably 15-30 minutes a day (As my stamina grows)

Am I risking myself in any way doing 15 minutes of jump rope on my rest days? Could I perhaps replace a running interval with it instead? I don't mind if it takes me longer than 9 weeks to hit 5 km if I hit my goal fitness to do MT sooner. 

Any input/opinions on how to best handle this would be appreciated!

48,Conditioning?,"I started C25k a couple of weeks ago (kind of inconsistent at first‚Äîsomething came up after I did W1D1 and it really took me over a week to do those 3 days because of how busy I was). I got back into it, kind of finished the first week, 2 of the 3 days I had to stop running about 45 seconds into my final run of the day. Even though I was really close to actually finishing, I‚Äôm still repeating the week because I technically did not successfully complete it.

I‚Äôm also repeating the week because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to handle longer runs. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have the stamina‚ÄîI regularly do 45+ minute long elliptical sessions without stopping, and before all the gyms shutting down during COVID I started doing the rowing machine and other strength-building cardio stuff. With running, though, I get absolutely exhausted.  My legs burn and my lungs hurt.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm overweight, but running seems to exhaust me 10x faster than other types of cardio.

I‚Äôve been reading on here and several people have suggested running at the slowest pace possible, which I‚Äôve been trying to do, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping much. Is there any other kind of conditioning training I can do, or do I just need to push myself?",C25K,1598496173,MiyaDoesThings,5,1,True,2020-08-26

I started day one on June 17th and on the 24th of August I ran Day 3 of Week 8. I'm 31 now and I've been overweight to obese for the last 15-18 years. I have never gone below 200 lbs for the last decade and a half. Despite that, I've always liked a mild run/jog at my own pace and was able to run long distances given time. I started the C25K to relieve my stress and get my mind and body to be active. I've also been weight training a bit with quantified nutrition. Taking it slow to run has made me more consistent, confident at whatever I have been able to achieve so far. 1.85 mi is probably my longest continuous run ever. This has only motivated me to keep at this and do better. I want to practice and run 5k sometime in the future (2-6 months ).

Anyway. I'm curious about advice for what to do when I take a week off running to go backpacking. (To be sure, I'm ok about the the break because one of my motivations for running is to be a better hiker--the other is that I LOVE running, especially in the winter). If for example I finished, say, week 2 of the C25K program and then took a week off to go hiking, when I came back would it be best to go on to week 3? Do week 2 again? or go back to week 1?",C25K,1598582882,Strict_Casual,2,1,True,2020-08-27

Of course I wouldn't have gotten anywhere on my own without c25k and everyone here.

Have a nice weekend

At the very end of the run I did have a little pain on the right side of my foot but after a the cool down walk and walk back to the car it felt fine. I opted to go home and ice my feet just as  a precaution. I'm trying to avoid the the small problems that always cropped up when I ran.

It's been 4 days and the pain has subsided a bit, but it's still there and I'm hesitant to start running again in case it makes the pain worse. It's very frustrating to be on standby like this when I want to continue the C25K it makes me feel lazy. Has anyone else had this experience?

74,Running safely: Advice needed,"So, personal safety is a concern for me as a young female and a beginner in running. However, the more I read into it, the more conflicting opinions I get. For example, others claim that it is better to stick to a familiar route where you know the landmarks, have a way out and can easily tell if something abnormal takes place. However, others say it's better to switch your routes and schedule in order for you not to become a predictable target. Both opinions sound reasonable to me and I am confused. So, I would greatly appreciate your input. What do you do to keep safe? Do you switch routes? Do you carry your phone? Do you stick to busy streets? Do you prefer a specific time of the day?

13,Concerned - Advice Please?," Hi all,

I wanted to put a post up because I have started to get a little bit concerned with my fitness levels. I'm 24, male, 5ft7', and I weigh approx. 68 kg. I'm not overweight, and you wouldn't think me unfit if you looked at me. I was a 10-20 a day smoker for around 6 years, but I have been off them for about a year and a half now. I am also asthmatic, but very mildly, as the only time I take a dose is before a run. I do not take a regular steroid, I don't believe I need it. Only other thing worth noting is that I do have a severely deviated septum, and restricted airflow through my nose. As a result, I mouth breath while I sleep and when I'm jogging.

A couple of months ago I got to week 8, and I was running for a full 30 minutes without stopping. I then got ill, and took about two months off jogging. I've been back jogging for about 3-4 weeks, and I have been doing every other day (sometimes I leave an extra days rest in).

Yesterday I managed to do W6R1 but I was quite tired towards the end. My fitness band says that I run at a pace of about 9 km/h when running, and I'm in the aerobic zone when running. The day after a jog I feel REALLY tired, and when I stand up, I get a bit lightheaded and feel off balance. This happens normally, but seems to be worse the day after a run. Once a day has passed, I usually don't feel too tired and feel normal and ready to run again. I'm worried about why I am this way at 24 - is there something wrong with me?

Side stitches have been an issue for me since childhood. Surprisingly, they didn't start limiting me in C25K until week 5. I happened to run W5D3 on an empty stomach, and while I didn't get a stitch, I had an upset stomach for hours afterward. Currently unable to get past the 12 minute mark of W6D3.

  
Things I've tried:

\- Eating 2-3 hours before running, or right before running (doesn't work)

\- Running before breakfast (no side stitch, but caused upset stomach, which was worse)

\- Breathing 2/3 or 3/2 (doesn't help, but my anxiety sometimes causes me to hyperventilate without realizing it...)

\- Slowing down: even jogging comically slow (probably 3 MPH)  doesn't help, I have to walk for the pain to stop.

\- Doing planks to strengthen abs (this has only been for \~2 weeks, so not enough time to make a difference)

47,My story and experiences of the program upon graduating,"So after completing and graduating the program (UK One You version/BBC/NHS) for the second time since the time before (8/9 years ago), I thought I would share some of my story and experiences in the hope it motivates those following this subreddit to also graduate.

**The backstory to the 2nd time around.**

I first completed the C25K program back when it was a podcast by the NHS, with a pre-selected playlist of songs which was narrated over by the lovely Laura. At the time I took it up to aid to combat the dark dog of depression that came as a result of the quick succession of unexpected deaths and the breakdown of a 7-year relationship. Yep, life was very shitty but the support of good friends and this program helped keep the dark dog under control. So what happened, why did I do this again? Life. That is what happened. Crap shift patterns, longer working hours, fewer days off led to me sacking off runs to spend the limited free time with my partner. I got fatter and heavier (increased to 116kgs/255lbs/18stn at a height of 5'11"") overall fitness level dropped. But a new career better shifts and free access to a gym during my working day allowed me to get some form of fitness regime back in play, however, avoided running out of embarrassment in not getting past 10-15min at my old pace, with others around me surpassing me. I did some cardio still, mainly bike and rower only doing the bare minimum in running needed to pass the annual fitness test. When progress was being made, lost a little weight (down to 105kgs/231lb's/16.5stn) Covid-19 came along with it the closures of gyms, including the one at work. So I was lost, my morning routine of the gym before work or after when on nights was no more, but needed to do something, so I returned to the trusty C25K program and the now evolved form it now has.

**Experiences and things that helped me succeed**

* The first thing and it is something I have seen many posts on here being disappointed about results upon graduating, this program aims to have you either running 5km's non-stop, running 30 mins non-stop or 5kms in 30mins non-stop. Do not be disheartened if you come to the end of the program and only covered say 4kms in 30 min, as long as you run the whole time, it has done as designed and is a great achievement.
* Form a pre-run routine/ritual and set time to do your runs. For me this was easy, I would normally wake up around 0430-0500hrs to be ready at the gym for 0600hrs, so the morning became my morning run session with my routine consisting of waking up, a pint of water with multivitamin and cod liver oil, a black cup of coffee (and since W4 of the program a tablespoon of peanut butter) then empty bladder/bowl before going out the door. Sat with my morning coffee with some motivational music helped set my mindset on what was ahead. Preparing my kit the night before, such as putting my earphones and phone on charge, running clothes on the sofa ready gives the additional motivation to get out. 
* I can't eat upon waking, have not been able to since I was 12, however, W4 I was flagging and was speaking with someone who participates in Ironman events who gave me a useful tip in regards to nutrition. Gave me a great tip about trying half a banana or tablespoon of peanut butter before at least 15min before you start and have to say I found it a game-changer.
* There is no such thing as a failed run or failed week. Bold statement I know, however, if you have built the motivation to lace up and get out the door and have given your best effort and was unable to run without having to take an additional walking break, don't label it as a failure. A failed run session is when you have not bothered to go out or even attempted to. You may struggle to complete runs in a week, this is normal. I struggled at W4. If you did struggle with a week repeat it, I did this for W4 and I am sure there are many on this Subreddit that have repeated weeks or runs throughout the program, there is no shame in this and you have not failed a week. 
* Speed and pace will develop over time, the more you run and distance you cover. Initially, with the shorter run intervals, you will end starting fast, but the longer the intervals become, the realisation comes that you may have been going far too fast and it is not sustainable at the longer run times. You may see your pace time increase per km as intervals become longer and you find your ""forever pace"". As mentioned in the first point, The program has 3 aims, so even if you are a member of team turtle/tortoise as long as you've been plodding on for the full interval/run times you can achieve 30 min non-stop, before looking to achieve those distance PB's and increase pace/speed.
* Music, podcasts and audiobooks can help you mentally tune out, especially on those longer runs. I found music helped me massively as it helps with cadence and SPM and allowed me to resync my pace if I lost it. A website called jog FM (www.jog.fm) helped me create a playlist of songs I liked to put in the mix, plus on I know that various music streaming services have a pre-made playlist to certain BPM that can help. Many on here use audiobooks and podcasts to overcome the working out run time based on track length. It is something I have yet to have experienced, but I do have a large selection of music on my playlist.
* Outdoor over the treadmill. I know many may prefer the treadmill for different reasons, from weather to fears of being judged by others seeing you running.  That is fine, however, if you can get out for a run. It will help alleviate the boredom often felt on a machine and will help you develop a natural pace and realistic understanding of the distance covered. 
* Invest in some half-decent trainers. It will reduce your risk of shin splints and other injuries including slips. You don't have to spend hundreds of ¬£'s. Mine cost me ¬£30.00 from sport direct. Make sure they have plenty of cushioning, decent insole and tread. If you are suffering from sore feet and shin splint, you may be worth getting your gait measured and more custom shoes depend on how serious you are to take this up going forward.
* Listen to your body. If you are ill or feel like you have an injury that is more than a tight muscle, take the time out to recover then return to it. There is no point in possibly putting yourself out of action for a prolonged time when it could have been avoided with a couple of days rest. Any major pains in the knees or feeling of ripping under the skin go and see your GP. 
* Opinions of others that see you looking like a panting crossbreed of a snail and tomato are not worth thinking about. Focus on yourself and why you are looking the way you are, what you are aiming to achieve and feeling upon achieving it. Many of us have performed opinions when it comes to those who like a swan passing by effortlessly as looking down on you, when in fact those I have passed or bumped in to have been friendly, polite and down to earth passing pleasantries and one who encouraged me massively on a segment of a run. Don't fear other runners and if you see someone starting to give them a nod, encourage them, acknowledge them will make their day and onward running experience better. 
* Track your runs. There are many free apps out there to help track your runs. I use Strava, it is like Facebook for runners without the inappropriate far-right uncle, can compare times with others in your area or add family friends to complete monthly challenges and is compatible with many fitness wearables. It is a great way to see your progress and log PB's. If you want to add me on Strava ask and I will send a link.
* Post-run selfies on this subreddit. Again another way to encourage others starting their journey and receive encouragement from others too. Also, they are great to look back on.
* C25K can aid in weight loss. I have not changed my diet in any way, I am not CICO or Keto or on another restrictive diet but have reduced my weight down to 98kgs/21lbs/15.4stn from 102kgs/224lbs/16stn when I last weighed myself in June. If you are on an extreme calorie-controlled diet I would advise speaking with a medical professional before beginning this program as you may run the risk of serious harm. 
* Water. Drink more water, you will be amazed at how much you will lose, so make sure you are increasing your water consumption.

**What now?**

I have a couple of goals, one being to reduce my min/km (pace) and also run longer and further. To begin I will be looking at increasing run time and distance and will continue posting to this subreddit and encouraging others too also graduate.

55,Post W5D3 slump,"I started this program in April and got passed W5D3 but fell off for weeks due to a death in the family and related travels that lasted weeks. After about two months without running, I set myself back to W4D1 in hopes of kickstarting back into the same endurance I had previously worked to. 

In doing so, I was able to beat many of the days that took my multiple attempts in my first go around - this felt so promising. 

I was so motivated, I bought myself two pairs of new (well, used but new to me) running shoes! My consistency has been off with summer heat  - even when I attempt to run in the mornings before it gets warmer, the beating sun makes my runs miserable and I end up not completing. I feel like I‚Äôm wasting away all my endurance progress that I was so committed to through even redoing weeks. 

Today, I started a lower dosage on my anxiety medication and found myself feeling a shortness of breathe that had me quit my run 2minutes in. I went to my room and cried - so upset with myself that I‚Äôve been trying to get passed W7D1 for almost two weeks now. Disappointed in my lack of consistency. I sat up, wiped off my smeared makeup, and threw on a more breathable outfit before making a special trip to a nearby running path to TRY AGAIN. I don‚Äôt want my anxiety to control me. I still didn‚Äôt complete W7D1 but did run for 14 minutes straight before walking back. I feel a bit better but still struggling with this slump.

So a little bit of background. I'm 24, male, about 70 kg and I'm asthmatic. I was a 20 a day smoker from the ages of 17 - 22, but I have been given up since 2018.

At the moment, I'm on W5D2 and it's 8 minutes on, 5 minutes off, 8 minutes on. I take my asthma inhaler prior to jogging, yet I still find it very difficult to breath towards the end of the run. I'm feeling really miserable because I'm barely capable of running without my inhaler, and it feels like this is a really easy run (and that I shouldn't be struggling).

14,"Graduated from an ""accelerated"" C25K today! Here's my progression.","Just for some context -- I'm around 5'6"", 135 lbs, and would describe myself as skinny fat. I grew up doing cardio sports like soccer and swimming, but stopped and developed an extremely sedentary lifestyle after starting college. I'm a few years removed from college now and the extent of my exercise prior to this was just a ~45 minute walk every other day. 

I experimented a bit and hopped around the first few days of the program, eventually settling on Week 3 because that felt like a good starting point for my fitness level. I followed the program and completed Weeks 3-5 to a tee, eventually reaching Week 6. Even though I struggled through and barely finished W5D3, this was actually the point where running really clicked for me. Looking onto Week 6, I saw that walking breaks were reintroduced and I didn't want to go back to that, especially after seeing how I just ran ~20 mins non-stop. So for the entirety of Week 6, I pushed myself to do W6D3 (2.25 miles). After completing W7D1 of 2.5 miles, I thought to myself that another 0.5 miles was totally doable and I just needed to push through for a few more minutes. Today, when I was supposed to do W7D2, I ended up completing the entirety of the 3 miles. 

From start to finish, I spent around a little over 4 weeks on C25K. Overall, I think what really helped things click for me after W5D3 was the mentality of just adding a few more minutes onto my runs. If I could do 20 minutes non-stop, what's another 5? Then what's another 5 after that?

I feel like I‚Äôm going at a turtle‚Äôs pace, though. Not sure how fast I‚Äôm going since I didn‚Äôt track it on my Fitbit. I know I was going just over 6mph for the intervals on week 2. Definitely slowed it down a bit for week 3. Dunno if I should maintain  my current speed through the week, or if I should run faster on the 90sec intervals and slow it back down for the 3min intervals..? 

I just want to be able to run for 5+ miles at a time already! Ideally, pretty quickly!

74,Stomach pain while running,"Hello folks, i finished my W2D3 today. I have been taking this program very seriously. In fact, I was in such a bad shape when i started that I repeated W1 over two weeks. Not that im obese but im definitely overweight and completely out of form. I also have flat feet so i bought a nww pair of Asecs to help me with the run and get accustomed to the feeling.

Now in week 2 when i though most of my problems were gone, i have a new serious problem. When i run, i get this acute, sharp pain jn my upper right stomach/abdomen. I did some research because i was worried and discovered that it was a vwry common problem faced by runners. I have tried a few things to get rid of it. Today i made sure i did not consume ablny water for at least 30 mins before work out as suggested by a friend. That did not help.

The pain today was not as acute and crippling as it was yesterday but it was definitely there. Every time i tried to run faster, i could feel it building up. Is there any way around it? I end up shuffling my feet through the last 1 or 2 runs because the pain is so bad and prevents me from breathing in fully as it hurts when i draw in a full breath. I havw noticed that my hear is accuatomed to the daily run now. Its my abdominal pain which worries me.

Please guys i need help or im afraid i m8ght mot be able to complete the 5k. Any advice will help. Please and thank you.",C25K,1595979146,therealcocoboi,12,1,True,2020-07-28

I rang my doctor, upped my meds, and took a week off, and I'm physically fine now: my lungs are basically back to normal function. Sadly, I'm not back to where I was in week seven, and I'm currently redoing runs from the early weeks to try and figure out where my lungs are at and build their stamina again. Basically I'm thinking that when I come to one I can't handle I'll know what level I'm at? (Also I'm not sure how much muscle you lose in two weeks? I'm a short plump woman and I don't put it on easily).

I managed a week 3 run fairly easily today, which is nice, but I hate the thought that I basically have to start again. I guess pride comes before a fall, but I was really proud of never having to repeat a week before, and it's just really demoralising to think that if I hadn't had to spend a week wheezing on the couch I could have finished week 9 by now.

59,Ready to move to week 5 now!,"Hello All!

A little back story:  I completed week 4 the week before last, but due to me pushing myself a little too hard I really struggled with breathing during the last minute to two minutes of the last 5 minute run.  I decided to repeat week 4 (calling it 4.5 lol) so that I could learn to slow down so that I would be ready for week 5.

I got started last week, on monday, doing my W4.5D1 run, then I ended up needing to go to my parents house several times to get some really heavy loads of stuff as they're moving to another state in a little over a week.  Tuesday of last week was the first day I went up there, and I slightly tweaked my back, and did a lot of heavy lifting which really tired out my legs (lots of squats).  I decided to take a break from running last week as to not over-do it.

This week I wanted to get back into it as I knew I wouldn't have as much craziness to get from my folks house, so I started ""week 4.5.5"".  I figured since I already did w4d1 a second time the previous week, I would start off this week doing w4d2 and finish this week with w5d1.  I'm happy to say that I have really learned to pace myself, and w5d1 went AMAZINGLY today.  I felt so good during and after the run, such an encouragement.  Next week I will start off by doing w5d1 again, then continue week 5 as planned.  We'll see how w5d3 goes :)

Thank you all for your encouragement.  Also ... as a side note.  I had a Dr Apt this morning, and I'm down another ~7lbs since my previous apt which was about 1 month prior.  I'm down a total of 22.2lbs :D  Hurray to being healthier!",C25K,1595009239,doublemintben,0,1,True,2020-07-17

70,Graduated today!!,"I just finished my W8D3 which is 30 mins of running. It was a horrible run, and i think i might be developing shin splints, but i still ran my first ever 5k. Definitely did not do a 5k in 30 mins, more like 32 lol. Did I actually graduate tho? I had to tie my shoes mid run, so that means i stopped and didn't continuously run for 30 mins... Do i have to re-do this week??

I still don't completely enjoy running, although there were times when i had good run days--when i feel like i could run at a faster pace longer. They're rare, though.

What should i do now after C25k? Do i have to run 5k every time i run? Will i lose the stamina if I don't? Can i do like 2.5-3k and 5k alternately every other day? I will be doing some speed intervals in about a month, but for now i don't wanna focus on speed yet.

I feel bad because most people my age (16 year olds) run a 5k in under 25 mins and i'm so slow compared to them. My pace is also worse compared to my previous runs. It's not the worst but i think i start off really slow because i can feel the pain in my legs while running. It fades away after a few minutes. I don't think that's a good sign but I don't wanna stop running and start all over again. Any advice?

For anyone doing this program, keep going!! I could barely run for 30 secs before i started this program, but now i can run for 28 mins and more continuously! It definitely works. During the earlier weeks, i did an extra day 4 for every week so i would be mentally and more physically prepared for next week's challenge. I stopped doing that after week 6 because I felt ready for what lies ahead.

I have NEVER regretted a run. That's something that I always keep in mind whenever i feel discouraged. Yes, there were bad run days, but if you still went out the door and ran for even just a second, take that as a win. Good luck on everyone's journey!!",C25K,1595076481,ch4rot,2,1,True,2020-07-18
72,W4D2: walking pace is horrible!,"I'm on my third attempt at C25k over the past three years. Had to stop during the previous attempts due to injuries both times. This time I've been taking it *extra* slowly - I've been at this for two+ months and have only just started week four this past week. I am determined not to push too far too fast and, so far at least, it seems to be working. Whew!

I repeated week three multiple times and while it never felt *easy*, I could complete the jogging intervals and was even reasonably happy with my pace. Wasn't fast by any means, but it was consistently improving and I wasn't getting hurt. I'll take it! Week four though - not what I expected! While I'm jogging it *feels* like I'm barely moving, but it turns out that I'm doing... okay... on the jogging intervals. But my walking pace has gone to the wolves. For W4D1, my *overall* pace was slower than my walking pace from W3D3! Got slightly better with W4D2, shown here, but only because my jogging pace improved. Walking pace remains stubbornly, horribly slow. Can't seem to get my legs to move during the walking intervals.

I just need to be patient and keep working at it... right? Or am I missing something obvious here?

My left shin has been sore whenever I put pressure on that leg since then. I've had sore muscles before, and even shin splints that go away after a day, but this feels different.

So I skipped my run on Friday because I didn't want to make it worse. Which was pretty disheartening, the first time since I started that I haven't completed all 3 runs each week.

Now it's Sunday, so I'll have rested for 4 full days without a run. My shin is a little less sore, but still noticeable. 

Part of me is worried to get back into running again tomorrow in case I make it worse. But another part of me is worried that my running gains will start to decrease. Muscularly and cardiovascularly I'll start to fall behind.

How do you decide if you're okay to keep running even though your legs are sore, and how do you know when it's safe to push through the pain?

Also if I don't run tomorrow, how long before I'll start to lose my running gains?

I tried it last year and couldn‚Äôt get past week 4 where you run 5 mins at once, so stopped. This year I restarted from the very beginning as something to do in lockdown.

83,Feel like a failure at W6D3,"So up until now I feel like I've been making really good progress with this programme! I had to redo a run or two over the course of the last 5 weeks, but I always managed to nail it the second time and it's all been a really positive experience.

I've done W6D2 again a few times, I don't find it too bad. But W6D3 is impossible for me. I can't even get to 20 mins, which is weird because I breezed through that (ok definitely not 'breezed through' but at least completed) the 20 min run a few weeks ago...

96,I've conquered so many mental hurdles with this program so far!,"Man, I love this program! I feel so good! Here are some things I feel good about:


1. I used to be afraid of running outside because of others seeing me. I'm big and I feel slow. What helped me get over this was whenever I saw something I thought, ""They're thinking 'Good for her!' That is what I would think!"" Plus, they dont really notice me. I am not bothered by people seeing me at all anymore!



2. I have a new mantra to help with perfectionism and that is ""I just need to finish. I can do this. Slow it down if you need to."" The other day I had to pause the program and sit down for a bit before my final run, and instead of giving up in shame, I felt proud for running the last section! It's not void! Plus, I figured it was because I didnt eat enough beforehand. I killed it.



3. I did this program when I was fitter, and I have been beating myself up for being so slow and out of shape in comparison. I realized that I am proud that I push myself to wheezing/nearly throwing up/collapsing! That's hardcore, no matter the speed or distance. Also, today it dawned on me that my walking pace, my average pace and my fastest pace are all higher than they used to be when I did this before! AND I'm doing hills instead of the treadmill! 



4. At first, I couldn't finish W1D1. But I pushed through by working up to running for a total of 8 minutes, and walking for however long I needed to walk in between. I finished W2D3 today, and I think I will two more W2 days before tackling W3. I dont feel like I'm stuck - I feel like I'm being kind to myself and setting myself up for success.



Guys, I'm so happy and proud. This program has been great for my mental health as well as my physical health. Yall are beautiful and powerful!",C25K,1594235206,AbsurdPigment,3,2,True,2020-07-08

I have recently finished the 5K program. Have been doing repeats of 30 min runs about 3 times a week, for about 2 weeks now. I do about 5K in 30 mins, sometimes a bit more (according to the GPS anyway. My best was 5K in 27 min). 5K is still not  that too easy for me yet, and each time I go out there to do it, I somewhat suffer in the last few minutes. On my off days, I walk about 6-10 km give or take. But get somewhat sore shins sometimes. Still, I would like to up the bar of my running activity, health and excitement. I am not too interested in going for a 10 at the moment. If it is about slow/moderate paced activities, I think 3X5K and several walks per week are enough for me. I have read a lot about sprinting and its benefit on health but never done before.

19,I finished C25k and feel fantastic! Appreciation post.,"Just wanted to share this as an ""accomplishment post"" because I somehow completed this entire program and wanted to share. Wow, yeah. This honestly flew by, and I didn't expect it to be as accessible as it was.

I'm just gonna start by saying that this was a gamechanger for me. I'm a 19 year old guy and my teenage years were fairly lethargic and... uninspired. I didn't push myself as much as I should have, not only with exercise but with most of my goals. I wasn't very ambitious and until I'd done this program, I'd pretty much given up on trying as most of my attempts to pull myself out of my routines fell flat. In short, I didn't believe in myself. However, I decided to give this a try after discovering a track near my house and generally feeling pretty tired of how stale and mundane (aka: crushing) my life had been getting. I thought I'd give up after the first week. Well, suffice to say, I did not. This program might have started a domino effect that is going to change my life. 

Now, to talk about the actual process of _running._ I expected this to be work. I expected it to be something I'd have to drag myself out of the house and force myself to do with everything tool short of gunpoint. I suppose some days were harder than others, where I had to exert a smidge more effort to get out of the house, but really... No, I loved this. I very, _very_ quickly learned to love it. I'm not going to say it wasn't hard, but it didn't feel like work. It only took the first two runs maybe, for me to become addicted to the feeling of accomplishment, to the labored breaths, to the muscles being worked in my legs. I'm not sure how common this is - if most people have to force themselves; I think it's fair to say I'm hooked to the feeling of pushing myself. It became a struggle not to skip rest days and do the entire program day after day. In the later weeks, I ended up skipping rest days to do shorter runs. Unhealthy? Perhaps. Gratifying? Absolutely.

Now, two months later, I feel like I've finally taken some control over my life. Less lethargic, more inspired to take up longer goals and hobbies. The running is fun, endorphins are cool and all that, but the most powerful thing this program did for me was convince me that I can do anything I set my mind to. The ultimate proof of this was the final run, 9-3, where I decided to go as long as I absolutely could and managed to push 50 minutes. That's not something I'm going to do every day, but the fact I managed to do that in just two months makes me incredibly proud of myself. I'm also proud that I never gave up on a run; no matter how much I was struggling (5-3 made me question my existence) The only time I stopped a run was 6-3, where sharp pains in my ankle made me take a two day break. Coupled with certain parts of my life that began near the end of C25k - quitting soda, cutting down on weed/alcohol, fixing my sleeping patterns - I feel way better about life than I have since I was a kid.

Now I have a new hobby, and a new part of my life that is satisfying and healthy. I'm not sure what's next - I'll probably attempt the bridge to 10K program, since having concrete goals feels like it will be better for me than simply getting in a habit of doing a 30 minute run every day. I think my mentality is more suited for following programs and working towards something rather than falling into a routine. If anyone has any other running programs that you think I'd like, I'm all ears.

7,c25k small win! and question,"A few days ago I tried doing week 5 day 3 - the first 20 min straight run (which felt like it came out of nowhere btw! lol) and I wasn't able to finish. I got to 17 minutes and my back was hurting me and I ended up with a cramp and couldn't go any further. I felt so defeated. 

Yesterday I was planning on going on a run but was feeling bad all day. Feeling sort of nauseous and generally out of it. I thought about putting off my run until today but thought of my ""never miss a Monday"" rule and figured I'd go for it. I didn't want to end up regretting not going. I knew that going meant I may not finish, especially based on how I had been feeling all day, but I decided to give it a shot anyway... and I DID IT! I was so excited and proud of myself and I was genuinely surprised when the app told me I was already halfway. Such a great feeling! 

I'm not saying you should push yourself when you're sick, I'm just saying in my case, I was able to push myself a little and ended up feeling amazing afterwards. 

I do have a small question - is it normal for all of your runs to be similar lengths?

Along with that I‚Äôve always struggled with keeping my splits even, I seem to exponentially lose steam with each kilometre.

I know it‚Äôs not an impressive time to many I‚Äôm just happy I‚Äôve built up enough easy mileage that a 5k like this is achievable. I used to be terrified of how long a 5k run sounded.

Repeatedly on this sub i adviced new runners to push hard, but NOT TOO HARD. Listen to your body, pay attention to your posture, breathing, where you're stepping, yada yada. Well folks, I guess I should take my own first advice because I injured myself PUSHING TOO HARD haha. My country had lifted the total lockdown to a less strict version of it, so now solo running is allowed. Being unable to run for 10 weeks, I was eager to run again. I know I should not go all the way back to my regular distance even after lowering my pace. But I did 5k twice the past a week and a half and it felt good. I decided to run a little bit more, 6.5k, maybe 7k. I end up doing 10k out of pure silliness. It doesnt hurt at all afterwards but during cool down i can feel the ache, and by the time i reached home i'm limping. Silly, silly me. Now I'm out of running for at least 2 weeks. I guess the point of this post is, is to reaffirm my first advice to myself. Push hard, but NOT TOO HARD.",C25K,1591440935,ekhfarharris,0,1,True,2020-06-06

17,Semen Retention and running,"Are you guys aware of the discipline of semen retention and the benefits it brings besides discipline for men?

There are many benefits and I hope you guys do your research on those as they are tremendous! 

I run for life. It's to build the discipline for other areas of my life. When you run a specific distance, timed, you are accountable. If your time is way off the previous time doing it, you didn't try as hard. Beating your time takes will and determination and that dog mentality. This is why I run and this is why I'm on semen retention (nofap hard mode).

What are your thoughts on either or both? If you have any questions regarding semen retention, I'll be happy to answer them.

Here is a short video for those interested in regards to semen retention and running.

I could barely run a minute without having to stop and gasp for breath. I was ashamed of my level of fitness and the poor example I was setting for my kids by being so out of shape. 

Well, w5d3 was today and... I did it! Slow and steady but I just kept putting one foot in front of the other. 

I know it‚Äôs advice that‚Äôs often given round here, but it bears repeating:

* Run slowly. No, even slower than that. Don‚Äôt worry about the fact geriatric tortoises could pass you by - what‚Äôs important is that you just keep going. You can work on your pace later. 

* If you can, try running without any headphones for the first few runs. It‚Äôs really helpful to keep you concentrating on your breathing. And breathing is key.

* When the runs get longer, I recommend a podcast over music, but everyone is different. Currently working my way through a History of England, which I thoroughly recommend.

* Get a friend/partner/family member to stay on your back about going. There‚Äôs been a few days where left to my own devices, I wouldn‚Äôt have made it out. I‚Äôm so grateful for my encouraging SO.

25,Kind of early graduated the C25K program today?!,"&amp;#x200B;

![img](qq9vyjzw4d351)

So I actually started to develop a hip injury after completing W4D2 last Thursday, 5/28, and haven't run in over a week since then. I wasn't feeling in a great mood today and decided to go for a free run to see how much I could push myself after doing nearly 5 weeks of the program. I am shocked and sooo proud of my body for basically doing a 5k (and some) today!!! It was a very spontaneous decision so I honestly didn't fuel/hydrate properly beforehand and was nervous that I wouldn't have much in the tank, and even though I didn't have the most energy I ended up doing the following intervals and even felt like I still had a bit left in the tank when I stopped! 

*Intervals: 5 min warm up walk / 20 min run / 3 min walk / 10 min run/ 1 min walk / 11 min run / 1 min walk / 14 min run / 5 min cool down walk*

But I did 55 min of running with only a total of 5 min of walking in the middle of it! I was an athlete in hs but was always one of the slowest on my teams and have really struggled to try to stay in/get in shape during college (am a rising senior now). Gonna finish out the last 4 weeks of the program to try and improve my time (shooting for sub 35 min 5k) and then move onto the 10k program! But for those of y'all starting in Week 1 or 2, this program really does work even if you feel like you can't even run 1-1.5 minutes straight yet -- you got this!",C25K,1591481651,emr2220,1,1,True,2020-06-06
27,"C25K, Week 7, Run - A story about daring to dream","I have arthritis and haven't been active in 25 years. I have been able to do some workouts like hiking and strength training during good periods. I started C25K on April 23rd and have been following the program as closely as possible. Of course, as for many others here, I didn't have that high a belief in being able to run after so many years, especially with several problematic areas that cause considerable pain during rigorous workouts. 

From the beginning I quickly got reminded of how competitive I am towards myself and I put together a Spotify-list with encouraging running music. 

The program went well and coinciding with the running I completed 11 hikes during May. (Mostly on rest days.) All this activity took its toll, but it also moved the borders of what I initially thought was possible. 

This week (Run 2, Week 7) I failed in running for 25 minutes straight and went on to do it the following day, The weather has been extremely hot the last couple of days, and I do think I started off with a too high pace. 

Today I woke up knowing that Run 3 was remaining, Having found a new route that is exactly 5k I decided to just run. Keep control of my pace and find a decent rhythm. My body didn't feel particularly energetic or well rested, but the temperature was much more comfortable so I decided to just try running instead of doing 25 minutes only.

After the 4k mark I hit a steep uphill portion which almost made me stop. The mental struggle really kicked in and I finished at 5k. What a wonderful feeling. It felt like I had fulfilled something that I hadn't even considered around Easter time. Hitting the 5k mark was great, but what made me feel even better was having gone through the pain and struggle of it all without tapping out. 

To anyone considering the C25K-program but are having second thought. Give it a shot. If you fail a day or a week. Keep going at it. Do not give up. Do not postpone beginning. Go out on this journey and realize how much it will give back to you. Even if you can't finish it for any reason. 

My vision was to be able to put on my running shoes and go for a random run whenever I feel like it.

That is now accessible and possible and it took 7 weeks. Incredible. I urge YOU to do the unthinkable too. Your mind might play games on you, but you will prevail.",C25K,1591482701,Tommygull,0,1,True,2020-06-06

About 8 years ago I was around 252lbs and on week 6 of C25K - I'd just hid the middle of the first running section, and neared a roundabout near my home, and a car with 4 guys drove round it, and stared hurling abuse at me - fat cunt, look at how slow fatty is, look at him if he falls over he will look like a fucking beached whale... - no big deal, head down and carry on jogging. Then they did a full revolution of a roundabout to do it again, then a 3rd and 4th time. 

By the time I had moved across the adjoining roads and started running up the next major road they drove the mile and a half along it in the direction I was running, u-turned, then proceeded to do it another 5 times. I cleared the top of the carriageway, and they were parked at the corner, all out of the car, just there shouting abuse at me. I ignored them and carried on running but when they finally stopped, 25 minutes after the first shout, 2 miles away from where I was now jogging. I was legitimately crying. I had shin splints, my calves were burning...but my heart was fucking broken. 

All the 6 weeks of pleasure and enjoyment I had built had just been destroyed. In one Evenings Run, I went from ready to run a 5k in a few weeks, to...depression, despair, hopelessness...

I finished that run, and said to myself - fuck those guys, this was a painful run, but I'll get back on the horse, 2 days rest to recover, repeat week 5, give my body a chance to heal stronger....

But I never went for a run again, never did week 5, never did start week one ever again. Every time I attempt to start...I get angry for not wading through the bull shit and continuing then. I let those idiots beat me, even if they never saw it. Now I still get nervous, afraid to go out for a run. Afraid to work out. Have never been to a Gym, still  ashamed of who I am and what I want to do.

I'm sick of it. 8 years later these knob heads are living rent-free in my head. Today is the day I change that, today is the day I start W1D1.

Thought I'd give out some unsolicited advice for people just starting out.

1. Chug water a few hours before your run -- especially if you live in a hot and humid place. I run super early in the morning and I chug an entire bottle of water the night before. I used to get really winded when I didn't drink enough water towards the beginning of the program. This is the only reason I've survived having to run in 30 degree C weather.
2. Don't heel stride -- it'll just give you shin splits and achy calves. Land toe first.
3. Save food for after the run -- give it a good 3 - 4 hours after you've eaten to run. I learnt this the hard way after I could feel the two tacos I'd eating an hour before W2D1 bouncing around in my stomach.
4. This is for my bigger-busted sisters -- if you're pinched for cash and the good sports bras are too expensive, double up on regular ones, even if they're barely supportive alone. This works surprisingly well and keeps them in place.
5. Inhale through your nose, exhale through your mouths and take deep breaths -- I've never been able to do the whole ""sync your breathing with your steps"" thing but this works great for me. Keeps me from getting winded too soon.
6. If you run in a frequented area, don't speed up when you see people -- I used to this almost subconsciously until very recently and it would completely throw me off my established pace.

Don't really have anything else. I'd love to hear your advice too! I'm terribly slow (7.5 min/km) and it doesn't look like I'll be able to hit 5K in a week so let me know how you sped up!",C25K,1591579739,yellowjacketsnotbees,3,1,True,2020-06-07

At the end of the 3 minutes, I am miserable. Now week 4 wants me to do 3 minutes and 5 minutes running. I don't run fast, it's not much faster than a walking pace while keeping a jogging motion going.

Am I just being a fraidy cat? Should I try this, or do Week 3 again? I just can't imagine mself running for 5 minutes straight.

Thanks in advance for any help!

**tl;dr** Week 3 is a max of 3 minutes running and I'm miserable at the end. Now week 4 wants 5 and I'm scared to even try",C25K,1591629886,Checkers10160,4,1,True,2020-06-08

84,Anyone Else Totally Fail W1D1?,"I've completed this program twice a few years ago and was in the best shape ever. However, after a diagnosis with PCOS, gaining 40lbs in less than a year, graduating with my masters, and moving to a new city to a job that's a sit-down 9-5, plus the pandemic limiting outdoor and gym restrictions in my area, I've been feeling pretty horrible about myself physically because I feel like I'm now in the absolute worst shape of my life... 



I'm an asthma sufferer and was always fine running as long as I used my inhaler 15-30 minutes before going out. I tried W1D1 yesterday because a friend wanted to start with me (they live in a different state) and I maybe made it half way before I just started absolutely heaving, quit and walked the rest of the way. I was absolutely embarrassed because I'm usually so much more  determined than that and will usually push myself to finish. I had to keep telling myself not to push too fast in my head, but even at my slowest pace, I was completely winded. 


I guess I'm just wondering if there's anyone else out there that maybe didn't meet their expectations on their first run and pushed through successfully? I'm feeling pretty down and some encouragement might be great.

91,Musings on my one-year anniversary of C25K,"One year &amp; two days ago, i put on a pair of shorts, a t-shirt, and some running shoes - and stepped outside to run (jog/plod along, really) for the first time since i was a kid. That was W1D1 of C25K, a program that transformed me in small ways and large ones - one that i will be forever thankful for. I thought I would check in on this anniversary, to the community that I called home for many weeks last year - whose support meant so so much to me. 

Running was SO HARD for me. Running is still hard for me, but I am still running, 3x a week. And every day that i run it still feels like a gift to me. A beautiful, amazing gift and something I never thought i'd be able to do or much less enjoy. Of course, it also sometimes feels terrible, but I don't let that stop me! ;-) I'm not a great runner, i'm not a fast runner. I'm not one of those folks who graduated and shot up to 25-30 miles a week and started running half marathons or even marathons, winning medals and such. Nope, I am not that person. I wish I was, and maybe someday I will be, but I've learned my body needs time to adjust, to strengthen, to grow. And I've learned that's totally okay. I'm slow, but I'm a far faster runner than I was when I started, and I can run so much farther and longer than when I began. I'm up to 10k on a really awesome day. I can't always do it. But I know someday I will be able to. For now, I just keep on pushing, keep on running. I feel so incredibly accomplished when i finish a run. It's amazing to push yourself for no other reason than to BECOME BETTER - be more healthy, have a clearer mind, stronger determination - just all around better. 

So, what is the takeaway? KEEP GOING. KEEP PUSHING. YOU CAN DO IT. YOU HAVE IT IN YOU. YOU ARE AMAZING. All these things are possible, all these things are true. Success is every day that you lace up your running shoes and get out there. That is \*still\* success to me, even now. And when you cursing yourself to get through a run, also remember in between all the swear words, that just running - 1/2 a mile or 5 miles, 16:00/mile or 9:00/mile - is an incredible gift you are giving yourself. Be proud of what you are doing. Be proud of what you have accomplish and what you WILL accomplish. I am rooting for you!",C25K,1591646665,morgiane,5,135,True,2020-06-08
92,How do you record your run?,"Hi all, 

Just wondering how you record your run?  I've just done my first '5k' which was the last challenge, which is 5m walk + 30m run + 5m walk.  I recorded it on Strava (the whole 40 minutes) as a run.

I just bought a new watch to record my running (Garmin 235).  I'm wondering if I should start the watch recording the activity when I begin warming up (leave the house) or when the 5m warmup has started and I start running?  Obviously walking slower affects the average pace the app calculates, so I want to know what the right way is to approach this.

I was really enjoying C25K, right up until the first 20min run. I was nervous but took on the ‚Äòtrust the program‚Äô mantra, put on a Hawaii virtual run on YouTube (lockdown struggles) and began.

Despite competing it, I realised I absolutely hated about 80% of the time I was running!

I then avoided running for a few days and then occasionally ran a few of the earlier runs again (W4/5) to try and motivate myself again but I‚Äôm just not enjoying it any more. 

I‚Äôm gutted because I was determined to be able to run 5k and if I‚Äôd kept the program up I should have been able to by now (also wanted to lose some weight but the distance was the main motivator!)

The Tough Day Easy Run is just 20 minutes, and I needed a win so I ran that guided that run. Somewhere around the half way mark, the Coach Bennet gave the best running advice I‚Äôve received since my short time as a runner.

61,Inner Knee Pain in one leg during program,"I've started running again, and I've been taking it easier to make sure I don't get any injuries. I was a cross country runner once upon a time, and every single time I tried to get back into running, I would go too hard too fast and easily injure myself. I've been doing a version of the C25K program this time, and I can do the 3 min run, 2 min walk fairly easily. 

However, on my last run a few days ago, I immediately felt intense pain in my left knee when I put my leg struck the ground as I initiated my run. I was able to find a sort of limping stride and the pain felt better. Over the past few days, it's gotten worse and I can't even walk around the house without limping. It hurts to sit and bend my knees in different positions, and it only feels better when I'm taking a hot bath. It keeps me up at night. It hurts like a bruise when I touch it. It doesn't look swollen.

The pain is located where ""e"" is located in [this image](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Hoehmann/publication/316099763/figure/fig4/AS:482888400543747@1492140974940/Differential-diagnosis-of-knee-pain-based-on-location-Knee-pain-is-a-common-complaint.png).

I guess my question is, if I'm not feeling exhausted after the official workout time, would doing a few more rounds of 5 minute run/2 minute walk help build the endurance to eventually run for 10 minutes and longer?

82,Accidentally finished W5D3,"Pretty excited about it and felt like sharing. Back in my college days I was a pretty competent runner. Used to pretty easily run 5-6 miles 4-5 days a week and was in great cardio shape. But after a few years of a desk top and craft beer, suffice it to say that I am not in good form any longer. I realized I was the heaviest I‚Äôve ever been in mid-April while sedentary for COVID-19 and decided it was time to change. I‚Äôm now down ~16 lbs and halfway through the program and feel great. But on to the story.

So tonight, tensions were running high at the house between me and the wife. We‚Äôre both a bit stir crazy due to being cooped up. I usually run M-W-F, but I needed to get out of the house to cool off and decided to do an extra run. I didn‚Äôt use the app because I didn‚Äôt really plan on much structure, just my watch. So I walk my 5 minutes then start jogging. After a while, I looked down at my wrist and realized I‚Äôd been going for 12 minutes without even realizing it! At this point I figured I‚Äôd go ahead and see if I could do the 20 minutes consecutive since I was so close.

Long story short, I inadvertently did 1.65 miles in 20 minutes of consecutive running and I‚Äôm pretty pleased with myself.

90,Advice about this weird sensation in my heels also how not to loose too much weight.,"Hey guys!!
I completed week 2 two days ago. I'm skinny fat so i don't have a lot of muscles.It was a pain to even walk for long. I have weak joints, my knees ankles and wrists hurt on and off but after running for two weeks i don't feel any pain in my ankles and knees which was a pleasant surprise
I'm just worried about one thing, for the last two days i have this tingly sensation in my heels, it isn't painful at all at the moment and when i poke my heels it feels as if a weak weak current is flowing through my feet
I don't know if its anything serious and that i should push through it because I don't wanna stop because im enjoying this program.

Another question would be since i loose wight pretty quick and i already weigh less should i take mass gainer so that i dont shed too much weight?

Any advice would be appreciated.
I'm just gonna end it with saying thanks to everyone in this sub you guys have motivated me and i hope to complete this program soon..",C25K,1590746917,NKbhd,0,1,True,2020-05-29

94,I made an app to generate run routes,"Hey Everyone, I made this app as a personal project for myself, but I quickly saw some promise in it, so I'm sharing it with everyone here. It's free to download so I think it's okay to post here, but let me know otherwise and I'll take down the post.

A big problem I had when going for runs was always running the same route. There's a couple reasons this is a problem. I was never a good track runner because I would get bored and focus too much on breath which would make things much more difficult. The same goes for running the same route over time. The other problem is that making a new route can be tedious using online distance measuring tools.

So, I made this app as a way to solve these problems. The app starts at your current location at finds routes at distance ranges that you specify around you. It's not perfect by any means, but usually after a couple generations, I'm happy with what it gives me. I'm willing to answer any questions and I'm very open to suggestions on how to make it better for all of you! Thanks so much for the read! Like I said, if this helps anyone else other than me, I'll be happy with it :)

The app is called RunGen and right now it's just for iOS, but if it gets a good enough response, I plan on moving it to android as well. Here's a gif of the beta version. It looks a little different now, but is essentially the same: [https://imgur.com/a/AlrbfDi](https://imgur.com/a/AlrbfDi)",C25K,1590756608,a7x802,8,1,True,2020-05-29

97,"Keep Going! Here‚Äôs some advice, almost 10 months on!","Hey all, LONG POST ALERT! I haven‚Äôt actually visited the sub in a few months since I completed the program. However, today I have been reflecting on my progress and the lessons I‚Äôve learnt since completing it. I‚Äôm by no means the best runner, nor do I have all the answers, but hopefully, someone might find what I‚Äôve got to say useful...

I initially started the program in September of last year. I was seriously unfit and hadn‚Äôt exercised properly since I was a teenager. My dad had just had a heart attack (he‚Äôs fine now luckily!) in August and it was a wake up call that I needed to make a change. I‚Äôd tried C25K before, but I couldn‚Äôt motivate/ maintain it. 

I started off completing the the programme on the treadmill, 1 day at a time. This is where I learnt my first lesson...

1. Sharing your achievements: whether it‚Äôs the fact that you‚Äôve completed day 1, week 5 day 3 (if you know, you know!), the program, or even just put on your running shoes on to try - share it with someone! This was honestly huge for me. I‚Äôd always been embarrassed of my fitness so didn‚Äôt want to speak about it, but starting off with a close friend who supported me was instrumental in my success with the program. Eventually, I built confidence and shared my progress with more people, including my family, and it‚Äôs kept me going to this day. 

As I progressed with the program, I continued celebrating every little win, letting my friend know about my runs. My biggest initial success was completing the infamous ‚ÄòWeek 5, Day 3‚Äô. Here‚Äôs the lesson that taught me: 

2. Believe in yourself! As corny as it sounds, from reading the sub and my own personal experience, so many people limit themselves saying ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to do this week twice‚Äô before they‚Äôve even tried it etc. Whereas everyone is obviously different, I found that, the majority of the time, we are capable of a lot more than we think. I found that verbally saying ‚ÄòI can do this‚Äô during my runs over and over really stuck, even when I didn‚Äôt believe it myself. Running is, at first, more of a mental battle than a physical one. 

Anyway, I eventually finished the program on the treadmill which was a huge achievement for me. I then transitioned to running outside which was a big adjustment, but I‚Äôm so glad I did. I completed my first 5K in November, clocking in at just under 34 minutes. After that, I began trying to whittle down my time - with a goal of getting under 30 minutes. This is where I learnt my next lesson! 

3. Maintain a goal: what‚Äôs great about C25K is that it gives you something to aim for and work towards. Luckily, I quickly set myself goals after finishing which kept my motivation up. However, knowing friends and family who have also since completed the program, their experience has been quite different. Without an explicit goal, my  mum has stopped running (apart from when I encourage her to). Keeping a goal, whether it be a time, distance or whatever, is really crucial. 

So as I said, my goal was to continue running and consolidating my 5K, with the aim of getting to under 30 minutes. In December, I pushed so hard to get this, and the closest I came is 30 minutes and 1 second! However, you guessed it, this taught me some more lessons! 

4. Recover! Don‚Äôt always aim for a PB! I did this in December and pushed myself too hard. I eventually injured myself and had to spend a couple of weeks off which wasn‚Äôt good. 

5. Get some new running shoes! I think another reason for my injury was my old shoes. They‚Äôd warn and were no longer supporting me as much. Since I changed them and recovered, I have been much less prone to injury *touch wood!*

In January, I got under that 30 minute mark. Then there was a global pandemic (don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve heard about it?!) and it was all a bit blurry for a while when my country put us on strict lockdown and I was unable to go out to run for a few weeks. However! Since coming out of lockdown, I‚Äôve continued running and smashing my goals. Here are the final 2 lessons I‚Äôve learnt from this...

6. Find a running buddy! A friend recently asked if she could join me on a run, to which I gladly, albeit a little hesitantly accepted. Little did I know, this would be a massive confidence and motivation boost. I always perceived her as being quite athletic, so running together and actually matching (if not, exceeding her pace, dare I say!) was a big boost for the guy who couldn‚Äôt run for more than 5 minutes a few months ago. This being said, having her there has helped me to push myself more, which has resulted in me getting more personal bests. Another big thing is the accountability this brings, both to actually going, but also to how you perform on your run. 

7. Pace tracker! This has been HUGE for me. Now that I‚Äôm trying to cut down my 5k time, I discovered that on my Apple Watch, I can set a target pace. My watch then updates me on this throughout my run, which again helps me to keep track of my progress and keeps me accountable. I‚Äôm guessing they Fitbit/ Garmin also have this feature - if you‚Äôve got one and haven‚Äôt tried it yet, check it out! 

Anyway, we‚Äôre coming to the end of my ramblings now. This post was genuinely to offer advice to others out there, but I guess it was a nice opportunity for me to reflect on my journey too. Last week, I got a new personal best of 27 minutes and 57 seconds for my 5K and today I ran my first 10K. Hopefully this shows that, even if you‚Äôre unfit and can barely run a few minutes like I was, it is possible! 

Hope you‚Äôre all staying safe. Keep pushing yourself and if you‚Äôve got any advice you‚Äôd also like to share, hit me with it! Peace!",C25K,1590765331,zebedeezing,12,6,True,2020-05-29

34,Help for consistent injury and no progress?,"Hi all, sorry for the long post but I‚Äôm desperate for advice! Two years ago, I (27F) found C25K and began the program. I have exercised on and off throughout my life and am at the high end of a healthy weight, but I had never run before.

A few weeks in, I got terrible shin splints. Tried everything (RICE, new shoes, compression sleeves, changing form), got discouraged and gave up. Started over and they came back. Rinse and repeat a few times.

Finally saw a doctor late last year who told me to take time off and then start slower than C25K - running just 2 minutes twice a week, and working up from there. I resisted this because it seemed SO little as to be ridiculous, but gave in and began this in February.

I worked up sloooowly, and eventually got up to 1 mile (doing nine minutes running, six minutes walking interspersed). Shins had twinges but seemed to be toughening up, no real pain, and continued stretching every day and icing frequently.

Then I began to get burning in my Achilles‚Äô tendon. After RICE, saw my doctor who believes it‚Äôs my calf muscle aggravating the tendon and causing the pain. Prescribed rest and a daily 40 minute stretching routine for hamstring, IT band and Achilles.

After over two weeks of the stretching, I still feel the burning whenever I flex my ankle/foot the wrong way so I have not resumed running. And I am so frustrated. It‚Äôs been two years of run, reinjure, rest, repeat.

Can my shins/calves just not handle this and I should switch to something lower impact? Or should I try to resume running and see if this is something I can just push through?

Note to add that I do strength training as well.

TL;DR: For two years, have never been able to run/walk more than 1 mile without injury to shins and Achilles. Should I give up running? Push past it? Other options?

85,An story after completing C25K,"Hello everyone! I would like to write a story about my experience, which can hopefully motivate others in completing their C25k journey!

I've started running a couple of times in my life, even managed to get to 5k a couple of times. For some reason i would always drop running again, and as soon as i had lost all my progress i would start again. 
This moment happened again in the beginning of this year. Having turned 30 not to long before this, i wanted to start running again to try and maintain atleast some form of physical health. I've got a desk job, and as soon i as do no form of exercise there grows a lot more of me to love.. 

Having done different plans in the past, i opted to try out the C25k journey this time. Each time i started running before, i always kept an eye on my pace and i would get upset if i couldn't reach a standard i set for myself. I think this is one of the biggest reasons i used to lose motivation. 
To prevent this loss of motivation i made a deal with myself to not track my pace for most of the C25k journey. Having removed this hurdle, i had a much easier time going through the program. So what if i was running slow, atleast i was out there running! 

i started my C25k journey on the 13th of Januari this year. The first few weeks went by pretty fast. It was tough, but certainly doable. Then week 5 arrived.. As most people know this is the do or die week in the C25k journey. Week 5 day 3 you suddenly have to run for 20 minutes straight?! This week was really difficult for me, but falling back on my ""don't care how fast you run, just run"", i managed to complete this week! When you make the jump to your first 20 minutes run, you will gain a lot of momentum to continue the rest of the program. If you've ran the 20 minutes, then how much more are all the other increments right?

I completed C25k on the 18th of March. I was doing maybe 4k in the 30 minutes instead of the 5k, but this was good enough for me.

After completing C25k the question was, what now. I decided to try and do a 5k to 10k plan, i opted for the App from Active. The plan started from 20 minutes as the longest run to 1 hour over the course of 8 weeks. On week 7 i managed to run 7,2 km in 55 minutes which was an all time PR for me. Last week was the final week 8 and i was planning on reaching 7,5KM in the 60 minutes. Having decided on a new fresh route for my final run i reached the 60 minutes and was feeling so good.. i decided to run for a bit longer. Before i knew it i hit 9km in 1 hour and 10 minutes!!! 
I'm currently doing a small rest week with 3 runs of 15 to 30 minutes max. It's amazing that in 4 months i ran 9km, where at the start i felt dead after a few small 2 minute runs.

For everyone currently doing C25k, stick with it! It works for sure, and even if it doesn't feel like it; you will improve really fast!",C25K,1589906025,Stingrayyer,5,2,True,2020-05-19

I passed a little snail along the way and decided it was a good omen. Snails don't trip, fall, and skin their knees (they don't even have knees). They move at a slow and steady pace so the snail is my inspiration with this C25k.

Boy was I wrong! I'm dreading the day when it gets to be too cold and wet for me to run outside. I find that I can push myself WAY harder outside because there's a natural ebb and flow of my pace whereas on a treadmill my body continuously goes the same tempo the entire time and even if I slow down it doesn't feel natural so I switch to walking.

97,My Strange Addiction (Long Post)," 

Allow  me to explain, I am a homebody and I have been for sometime. About a  year or so ago, the most I would do is go to work and then go to Zumba  (which I Loved) twice a week. I even stopped doing that when $40 per  month became less feasible for me. I'd jog (very,very,very) slowly maybe  once or twice a week for two miles or so and Very rarely five miles.

Recently  though with this stay at home order (which I have no problems with,  really stay safe, stay healthy) I found myself going out to jog a bit  (way late at night, I hate jogging with too many people around under  Normal circumstances). One day my mom and I were talking about how cool  it is that on certain workout equipment it makes it look like you're  going somewhere, or tells you you've gone halfway up the Taj Mahal or  something like that.

I decided to  look up virtual running, thinking something related to like a VR headset  and a couple of apps would cone up. Next thing I know I'm looking at  the Allstate Hot Chocolate Virtual Run, which, surprise, surprise,   ended that very day (4-30-20). So I entered the thing, paid the thing  and jogged (very,very slowly) for 3.2 miles.

Now  I've done two more runs since then (Geek Day and May the 4th, 5k and 4  miles respectively). I've registered for three more and have a list of  nine more I want to do of varying lengths (the longest one I have  planned right now is an (80's Retro 8k).

I'm  not going to lie, this has become a bit of an expensive hobby to  indulge in. But I'm not really one of those people who runs for ""The Joy  of Running."" That's not me; I'm not that girl. So even if I'm paying to  do something I could do for free, the medals, shirts and bibs that  eventually come in the mail are Great motivators for me.

I've recently completed the C25K program. I've noticed a huge improvement in my stamina, but the pain in the soles of my feet (and sometimes shins) hasn't gone away. It typically comes on after 1-2K and eventually I'll eventually stop noticing it towards the end of the run. 

I figured my feet would eventually get used to it, but after running for the last 2-3 months, it still comes on. Is this typical for new runners?

15,Why run slower?,"I see this advice on the sub often and just wanted to know more about the rationale.

I understand that you should be running slower if you can't complete your runs. I run slower on average now to make it a full 25 minutes in week 7 than I did just during my 1-minute run intervals in week 1. And I'm sure I'll have to slow down a little more to make it 30 minutes, then 35, etc.

What I don't fully understand is the advice to run at a ""conversational"" pace, as opposed to just a pace that allows you to finish the run. For me there's a huge difference between my (super super slow) conversational pace, and my faster pace that leaves me pretty winded but doesn't force me to stop running or anything. Sometimes I'll have to slow down for a bit to catch my breath, but why run at this slower pace the *whole* time, if I'm able to do a little more? I've read a lot about aerobic versus anaerobic training, and I know that the vast majority of time spent running long distance is aerobic. So the goal is to increase aerobic capacity.

17,Should I Repeat Week 6 Runs Until I Can Run the Distance?,"Just finished up week 6 yesterday. I'm wondering if it makes sense to move onto week 7 yet.

&amp;#x200B;

So, does it make sense to move onto week 7 if I'm not achieving the distance milestones? Should I try and get up to running 30 minutes straight/finish up through week 8 before chipping away at distance, or be able to run the distance now without worrying about the time?",C25K,1588009447,megdoesketo,6,1,True,2020-04-27

Two weeks ago I posted in this subreddit about knee pain from running. I've done research and found a lot of info on heel strike and how it can contribute to knee pain. That combined with low cadence when I started our running was pretty bad I guess. Now that I've adjusted and land on the middle of my foot rather than my heel I have no knee pain.

95,Mental hurdles and C25K,"I‚Äôm on my third attempt to complete C25K which I think I can attribute mostly to my hesitation about the mental hurdles that I need to jump through to continue to progress. The farthest I‚Äôve made it was through week 3, and looking ahead to week 4 really scared me off. 


What helps you get through the voice in your head that tells you that you‚Äôre too tired and you should start walking? I‚Äôm already working on breathing technique and do a pretty-okay job of maintaining a slower pace, but I always feel like I‚Äôm ready to give in to that voice way too easily. This isn‚Äôt just the case with running for me, but with most things that revolve around self-regulation and moderation. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúme problem‚Äù or if other C25K people have experienced similar issues? And if so, what do you do to work through this, other than telling yourself to ‚Äújust do it‚Äù?

I need some help going forward. Just to give y‚Äôall some context, I am male, 26, 6 feet, 170 lbs, don‚Äôt smoke and really want to achieve 5k goal. 

1. I lose my breath really quickly (like in 30s) once I start jogging (trust me I go really slow). Should I get something checked? 
2. The shin area of my leg hurts really bad after jogging 5-6 minutes (never hurts while walking even if it‚Äôs a long walk) Wondering if I should be seeing a doctor?

I am confused if I should be seeing a doctor for reasons 1 and/or 2 or is this a part of the game and should keep pushing my self?

0,How do you guys keep yourselves motivated?,"I started C25K on Monday, so far W1D2 was way harder than W1D1, partly because I was running in a pair of old Nike Airs that gave me heel blisters on the first run, that didn't heal in time. I was stubborn to not get a new pair of shoes before I started, because **I am setting myself monthly goals and rewards, this month I would have rewarded myself with new running shoes if I stuck to the schedule.**

But I caved and got a pair even though the month is not over - and today I completed W1D3 in them, and they were incredibly comfortable.

I am also **listening to Murakami's** ***What I talk about when I talk about running*** instead of music while running. It helps me focus because I'm concentrating on the narration and it keeps my mind occupied, rather than just having a beat to run to.

I'm interested to see how you guys are keeping up your morale/keeping yourself motivated in those tougher mornings when you're asking yourself ""why the hell am I doing this to myself""? Or if you have a reward system like me, what small rewards are you giving yourself?

5,Easily running 5k but have hit a wall,"So I started C25K about 3-4 weeks ago and sort of skipped ahead doing one run from each week until week 6.

In the last 3 runs I've easily ran 5k. 7 and 8 the last two. But todays run was worse than the last.

The problem is my legs are tired (not sore) after about 2km not sure if it's because I'm not getting enough food in or it's my muscles needing more rest.

I'm yet to run 2 days in a row and always take the day off between runs, I'm not sure if I should be pushing on towards the 10k or tone it down a bit and stick to the last 2 weeks of the program.

I'd really love to hit the 10km so I can start focusing on the sub 20min 5k.

My first run after couple months of not running and getting bigger, i managed to do 30min (about 3 weeks ago). Today, i just completed a 70min run, with relative ease after first 30mins. My knees felt it more than anything, but i think this just shows. Even if you drop c25k for months, as long as you keep some sort of activity going, you will go back to your peak in a matter of days/weeks (your lungs/breath get back in shape easier but muscle catches up)... if you slack, dont think your progress is gone.

Heard the prompt to begin my cooldown. Walked on for 2-3 minutes and did not hear the prompt that plays at the end of the run. Continued with my cool down for another 3-4 minutes, and finally took the phone out of my pocket. Unlocked the phone and I hear ""Begin your warm up""!

But sadly, I'm so out of shape that I've been taking the ""run"" portions of my W1 program at a slow jog. When I do this, I find that the first run segment is easy, the second is slightly less easy, and it's only towards the end of the third run segment that I start to feel out-of-breath. By the start of the sixth run segment, I'm wishing for death and mentally cussing out the peppy woman on my C25K app who says things like ""almost there!""

My question is: is it OK that I'm just doing a slow jog instead of a ""real"" run for the first week? I didn't want to push myself too hard at the very start of my C25K program because I was afraid I'd burn out, lose my enthusiasm, and drop the program before finishing. But I also wonder if I'm not pushing myself as hard as I should.

Follow-up question: if it \*is\* OK to start at a slow jog, does this mean that I should stay on W1 of the program until I can get myself up to a full run, during the run segments? Or should I modify the schedule in another way, such as doing the W1 runs every day, instead of every other day?

After I finished, I looked at the next day and feel a sense of doom. Like, oh NO, 3 minutes?! Not once, but twice?!

So after some stretching, I just went for it. I needed to rip the bandaid off. I know that I'd just keep putting it off if I waited. Oh my God was that hard haha.

4,n00b question,"I downloaded the app on Saturday because I heard a podcaster talk about it. I missed that this was a 3x/week thing and thought it was supposed to be every day. To answer my next questions, you'll need to know about me.

I'm a man in my upper 40's. About 3 years ago I lost about 40 lbs (mostly diet changes). I'm still slightly overweight (BMI around 30, down from 32+), having put on about 10 lbs this winter - that's not unusual for me, as I get more active in the spring. However, my ""normal"" spring activity is all cancelled, and I've got to do something to get more active. I've always been of the opinion that if I'm running, somebody should shoot whatever is chasing me, but here we are. I do have a bulging disc, but otherwise no physical ailments (hips, knees, legs, and feet were all in good condition).

So I did days 1, 2, and 3 on consecutive days (again, not realizing it wasn't supposed to be that way). On days 1 and 2 I just wore my everyday walking shoes (New Balance Walking DSL-2's are what I wear nearly every day throughout the year). I had no problems there, but I'm thinking these wouldn't be the best for the long-term. So yesterday it was warmer, and I dug out my Vibram Five Fingers, which I know a lot of people like for going running. The Week 1, Day 3 felt great! I felt like my form was better and I liked the feel of it. ...until I had been back home about 10 minutes. That's when I realized I've bruised the balls of my feet, and it's painful even to stand right now.

I would like to eventually go back to the Vibrams, but what do I do in the short term to get me there? How many days should I ""take off"" before starting the next one? Should I be icing my feet in the mean time because of the bruising? How active should I be with sore feet for the next xx days? To get used to running in the Vibrams, should I alternate shoes, maybe 2 days with NBs, then 1 with the Vibrams?

15,My Week 5 Experience: there‚Äôs power in the playlist,"Like a lot of folk, I‚Äôve picked up C25K to replace my indoor exercise programme during Covid lockdown, and it‚Äôs going pretty well.

(Also like a lot of folk, I live alone and am furloughed from work, so a little lonely and very bored - so you‚Äôll have to forgive my self indulgent story time here) 

Until I did W5D2, I mean. I really, really struggled with the 8 minute stretches and I made it difficult for myself by taking a different route from usual (so adding a level of slight confusion, different elevations, and without the help of my visual distance markers). The weather didn‚Äôt help either - glorious sun of the type that we don‚Äôt see in London often. 

I nearly threw myself in the river. I had to pause the app during the 5 min break, because I just needed an extra minute to catch my breath before I could face the next run. 

I knew it would neither be morally right nor physically possible for me to graduate to W5D3 without repeating day2 and doing right. 

I‚Äôve done every other run listening to an audiobook or podcast, because they demand my attention and provide better distraction, but as it seemed my big problem was going too fast (it seems I speed up subconsciously whenever I pass good looking or athletic people, maybe to seem marginally more impressive) I chose a playlist on Spotify with what I guessed would be an appropriately paced BPM for my do-over. 

And I did it! And the beat definitely helped - I still find myself going too fast but it‚Äôs so much easier to notice it and find my way back to the right rhythm. 

First 8 minute stretch, a few mins in, How Soon Is Now came on and I didn‚Äôt know how to skip track on my new headphone remote, so I had to run on the power of my own disappointment in what Morrissey had become. 

The start of the second run stretch coincided almost exactly with the start of Blue Monday by New Order, which I already knew to be around 7 and a half minutes long, and has that great synth beat to match your feet up with. I couldnt have planned for a better track. 

(During the cooldown, Don‚Äôt You (Forget About Me) came on and I confess I did a victory breakfast club fist raise in the middle of the park)

Confidence of having run longer than all of Blue Monday carried me right through today‚Äôs dreaded W5D3. Playlist du jour was 80s Stripper Rock.

35,is 2 sessions each MWF too much (continuing my progress and starting week 1 with friend)?,"Hey peeps... off and on lurker here with an odd question.

I'm getting back into cardio/exercise and want to retry running again, starting with c25k

Although I could probably finish a week 4 run right now (watch out Cameron Hanes), I decided to play it safe/logical and start from the beginning without skipping any days. I convinced a much less actively-prepared friend to start it with me, which I am super pumped about, and we finished W1D2 today which is amazing.

The problem is they are definitely really struggling already; they completed both days but keep saying they will likely have to redo week 1 &amp; some future weeks (though i keep saying they might surprise themselves)...  however, *if* they do repeat multiple weeks, I would both:

* Like to keep running along side them, both as supportive encouragement and, less, because we're both relying on my c25k galaxy watch app to alternate the time intervals (without it and me with them, they may be more susceptible to quitting)
* Like to progress to future weeks at my own pace as I am eager to move forward asap

so

**The question is**

Would it be a bad idea for any reason (on joints, or over-exertion, etc, etc) to continue running at my own pace (progressing to later weeks) AND *in the same day*, also run an earlier week alongside my friend at their pace?

I know there are plenty of recommendations against over-running (back to back days, skipping days or weeks, ignoring time intervals, etc)... but if I am a few weeks ahead, perhaps it's less-significant strain on my body to add the much less-intensive session on top of my own, or if that's more than enough to advise against considering... you guys are the pros; school me!

Any advice? I‚Äôm wanting to run today but at the same time, I‚Äôm worried these blisters with how painful they are (struggle to even just put a shoe on and walk) will hit my progress - especially as I‚Äôm starting a new training week today.

The next day, I wore a pair of Adidas superstars. Guys, my shins were SCREAMING at me.

83,Plateauing around week 6,"Hello Redditors of r/C25K, I really need your help!

So back in January I began the C25K programme on the treadmill at the gym. I made it to week 7 or 8, and was comfortably running for 20 or so minutes without stopping. Unfortunately, gyms in the UK have been shut due to coronavirus for about three weeks now, so I‚Äôve had to take my running outside.

I went out to pick up where I left off on the treadmill and just about scraped 25 minutes straight. It‚Äôs been downhill from there, unfortunately. I had to take a week out due to quarantining, and when I got back out I could scarcely run for 5 minutes, let alone 20. I went back to week 5, and worked my way back up to week 6, day 3 (25 minutes without stopping) which I attempted today. It‚Äôs just impossible. I can‚Äôt seem to keep going after 12 minutes. 

Does anyone know how to fix this? Should I just go back to the beginning of the programme to compensate for lost time and suddenly having to get used to running outside? I‚Äôm feeling really deflated and defeated, but I really don‚Äôt want to quit (mostly because I spent ¬£85 on trainers, haha). I don‚Äôt want to be stuck at only being able to run for 10 minutes either though. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Unsure if it matters, but my reasons for running are weight loss, overall health and fitness, and my mental wellbeing.",C25K,1586628529,siularaisling,8,3,True,2020-04-11

After all the gyms shut down (which I‚Äôm happy about in a public health sense), I was fairly upset. All I had left was W8D3 and my 5k attempt!

Its shamefully slow considering I was once much more fit, and faster.  Slow for me then was closer to 7 mph.  I ran almost daily for years...but life and all...

&amp;#x200B;

This morning I finished week 9, run 3!  If I can complete c25k then anybody can.  Really.  I mean it.  I've never been very good at steady state cardio but I decided I wanted to be a runner.  And now I am one.

Here are my tips based on what I experienced over the last 9 weeks.  These are some of the things that helped me get through it. Between week 7 and 8 I took six days off while I went on vacation but other than that I went straight through every other day.  I am 56 so I felt like I needed at least one day of rest in between runs.

&amp;#x200B;

\+ Just do it in the moment.  Don't worry about the future.  Not the upcoming intervals in your runs or future runs.  Just be in the moment.

\+ Listen to something to distract yourself from monitoring the time.  I like podcasts better than music because the keep me paying attention.  I recommend Serial and How I Built This as ones that will hold your attention and take it off the time.

\+ As you are working through the weeks.  Just focus on the time and not the amount of distance you are covering.  The distance will come later.

\+ Just keep telling yourself that you can do it.  Stop with the negative self talk.

\+ Keep reading this sub for all the great advice.  A couple of the things that I have read here that really resonated with me include one person who said that while running they tell themselves ""this is the hardest thing I'll do all day.""  And it's true.  Everything is downhill after.  

\+The other thing I read here is that the hardest part of this project is mental.  It is true.  Keep reminding yourself of that.

\+ Don't wory about anybody seeing you or looking at you or judging you.  You are out there moving so that makes you a step up from anybody that isn't out there moving.

&amp;#x200B;

Good luck to everbody that is working through the program.  What I'm on to next is to continue running every other day for 45 minutes and try to increase my distance.

I was a little more sore this day from the D1 routine, but I made sure to throw in some stretches after my D2 run, especially my feet w/ a tennis ball.  I'm also trying to stay a bit more hydrated on days off and throughout the day of a run.

Now I'm thinking about the 'leveling up' between the weeks and getting nervous for that...Might do a repeat of W1D3 before progressing to W2D1 just to be safe.

A few years ago I decided to do c25k. It worked for the first three weeks, but at the end of week 3 I was still struggling significantly, so I decided to keep following the week 3 walk/run times for the next week, and the week after, and the week after that. It wasn‚Äôt getting easier! I ended up giving up following that guide. Instead I started running for as long as I could, then walking till I was ready to run again, and repeat. And lo and behold, I was getting faster again!

I stopped running, and now a few years later I was back to square one. Last week I started running again, just doing my own thing and listening to my body. And each run I am faster than the last. I guess c25k doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, and even if it takes me longer to reach 5k (we‚Äôll see) I‚Äôm okay with that.

95,"W8D1, ran for 30 minutes, instead of 28. Am I a graduate!?","This is the first time I have ever finished a fitness goal. I have started and failed to complete my cardio exercises, yoga, pilates, kickboxing, even strength training. I even gave up on c25k, 2 years ago, after w2d2. This time I persevered. And managed to complete it! I am so happy.

I failed once on W7D1, which I finished at 22 minutes with breathing problems. I was determined not to fail again. 

I ran **4k in 30 minutes**, which isn't a great speed, but I'm still proud of it, coming from someone who could barely manage 30 seconds of running. I'm going to **complete my W8** runs and then officially graduate. Then I intend to continue at the same speed till 5k. Then I'm going to try for sub 30 5k.

*Some things I've learned while running:*

1- If you are having breathing problems, try this technique: **1 in, 1 in , 1 out, 1 out, in pace with each one of your steps. (** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx8ZytA2A2I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx8ZytA2A2I) ) This helped me immensely, as my main problem was being out of breath.

2- Get a goooood playlist, something which you can sing along. I tend to obsess over how much I ran, how much is left, how much I'm hurting, etc etc. Songs tend to keep your mind off those obsessive thoughts. I used to listen to podcasts, which will only help in the beginning weeks, not for the longer runs.

3- Lastly DO NOT GIVE UP!! If you fail or didn't do so good in a run, come back, search this subreddit, you'll find so many people in the same boat.

I used to run a lot, but haven't in a long time so its gonna take a while to get in the swing of things. I'm glad the program starts off relatively easy lol. I'll be sure to keep you all updated on my progress, and I look forward to seeing your progress as well. We may all have different reasons for starting this program, but we're all doing it together, supporting one another =)

1. Mainly will be doing this on a treadmill so I just need the time intervals.

2. I have barely any space on my phone and although I plan on making some more room, I‚Äôd rather avoid any additional use of space, as much as possible haha. 

Thanks all!

Feeling really defeated I couldn't complete the full 28 minutes, but positive I stayed and ran for 20 minutes with a 5 minute walk break.

35,W6D3 Complete (and first outdoor run),"Today is my wedding anniversary so I took the day off to spend time with my wife while the kids are at school. I needed to get a run in, but the idea of getting on the treadmill again just sounded awful. It has been nice here lately, but was about 45 degrees Fahrenheit when I decided to run. It was a little chilly, but not the coldest I‚Äôve run in and I knew I‚Äôd warm up quickly. Given that I have a 5k scheduled 18 days from now, I wanted to get at least one outdoor run in just to see how my pace and stride would adjust (and because I really needed a change of scenery). The run was great! I was careful not to go too fast since I felt like I was moving so slow- I wanted to make it through the run without walking, and I didn‚Äôt really care about pace. About halfway through I was still feeling good, and at about 3/4 of the way through I knew I‚Äôd finish strong. I wasn‚Äôt using an app that specifically tracked distance or speed, but from my best estimates it looks like I was going at a pace about 30 seconds per mile faster than what I normally train at. The change in scenery really helped with some of the mental fatigue and helped take my mind off the time. Hopefully the weather stays relatively nice and I can do more outdoor runs.

I have about 50 more pounds to go this year, but I'm going slow and steady, eating healthy, and feeling great... however...

About a week or 2 ago I had a bad run with a weird pain in my left leg- it wasn't quite my knee, but felt like it shot down my leg, more recently it's been the same type of pain, feels like a bone pain, but is more concentrated inside my thigh, almost groin, which has me thinking it may be a femoral stress fracture, and if it isn't is probably leaning towards one from over-use. Yesterday I did a 5k test run outside on the track. did a better time, and was proud of myself but as SOON as I stopped running, I felt the pain, as if my endorphins were masking it during my run.

64,W3 and my back story. Long post warning!!,"Hi there fellow reddit folks,

I am going to be 60 this year, female, two time cancer survivor. (I had two cancers at the same time in 2016 and one recurred several months later) after about a year of gnarly treatment and a lot of worry and weakness..I am now NED, two years out.    
I took a medical retirement, because well, metastases. But I feel ok.

one of my goals is maintaining my  current health as long as I can, and that means some sort of fitness.  I used to run for fitness and I loved it.  I despised running in gym class, it sucked.  Nobody coached us in middle school. Who knew diddly about pace, breathing or form?  It was real punishment.  Y‚Äòknow?

In spite of hating it as a kid I committed to doing it as a responsible grown up.  I started when I was about 35.  I ran on the local school track in the pitch dark so nobody could see me.  I was slow and I couldn‚Äôt effing breathe!!  For the first few minutes my whole body would object, screamingly.  But I kept going. 

I bought real running shoes, but always off the clearance racks.  And I kept doing it.  Finally bought a treadmill and slooowly worked up to running almost every day.  Miles and miles.  Sometimes outside, sometimes treadmill.  It didn‚Äôt matter, as long as I did it.

Now after all the cra...uh, ‚Äòlife experiences‚Äô I‚Äôve been through the past few years..I am doing this C25K thing, and it‚Äôs a lot easier than doing it myself.  I‚Äôm on w3 day 2.

3,"Going to start today, need help to get in the right mindset","Running was never my thing, I always hated it with a burning passion. Even when I was playing water polo for 3 years with 4 training session each week I couldn't run even a km without dying.

But I like the idea of actually having cardio and not being tired and out of breath from the slightest bit of excercise. For the last 2 years I didn't do any excercise at all pretty much, sitting 8 hours a day at work, sitting at home playing games or watching TV, playing games with friends, not the slightest bit of physical activity. And I also gained about 20 kg from eating loads of fat and sugar which made me feel even worse obviously.

But since I stopped smoking after 12 years (6 months going strong!) I am able to somewhat breathe again and I wanna try this whole running thing again. My biggest problem is that I already try to make up excuses to not go today.

5,What do you use to record your runs / listen to music / app?? Advice needed.,"Looking for some advice.

I have recently completed the C25K and am wanting to continue regularly, hopefully progressing to a 10k race in July.

I am however struggling with music/ apps and stats. 

Currently I have an android phone with two different running apps that are a bit meh.
The first one crashes and I have lost at least two of my runs and hasn't been updated since 2017. This has maps, stats and verything but it's not reliable.
The second one seems to work OK but you need to pay extra for stats and it doesn't even have maps.

Is there a fitness tracker with bluetooth mp3, coaching and stats or what do you use for this stuff.

I know I can map my route after a run on desktop and I do do that to see how far I have gone but it would be nice to have it within a working app.",C25K,1582820075,theworldsaplayground,3,1,True,2020-02-27

I can do this. I got an offer for the army, starting at the end of April. I've lost 25 pounds since November, but I am far from my goal. I want to show up to basic training as the best version of myself possible. I can do this. Evidently, I won't have rock hard abs or big muscles like some others will, but at least I will be the best version of myself that I can be. I can only achieve this by keeping my promise to myself, to better myself, every single day. I can do this. Every single one of my decisions should be made with my best interest in mind. I can do this. Every run I get in and pound I lose before basic training will be one I will thank myself for losing. Easier to start now than to wait and suffer when there's more at stake.

I‚Äôve never been a runner and have honestly always been semi-anti running. I‚Äôll swim and bike and do other things to be in shape but it never appealed, most likely because I could never really do it without trouble breathing and generally feeling awful.

My asthma is under better control than it‚Äôs been in years. I now have a daily inhaler I remember to take most days. I do martial arts regularly and used to need to take rescue inhalers for that and now I‚Äôve done training without remembering my daily inhaler or needing the rescue one. This is huge.

I am in pretty decent shape and have some stamina for HIIT type training. I plan to start with the None to Run because I would really like to work on my breathing and focus on my body to not reinjure.

34,Looking for some advice on shin splints,"Hi! 

I'm 30 years old 5'11"" male 250 lbs. I can already run a 5k without stopping in ~35 mins on the treadmill (I was pretty amazed with myself when I discovered that I could do this, especially at this weight.) My lungs can handle it. My upper leg muscles can handle it. I've been running a 5k on a treadmill about 3 days a week for a month or two. I'm relatively new to running, but I was running 5ks pretty much immediately without any sort of slow build. 

My lower leg muscles are having some trouble -- I'm getting shin splints lately! It's really irritating. I have some decent running shoes. When I went to choose some, the dude in the running store just had me take off my shoes and walk around the room and he watched my pronation. He then recommended some shoes. He didn't do, like, a full analysis. I don't *think* my form is bad, but those sound like famous last words to me. It's about an hour drive to a place that would do a proper analysis. 

Anyway, on to the advice--what I'm thinking is that I'll take a couple of weeks off of running, maybe do some light cross training like elliptical and stationary bike, and then start off with the C25K program, doing a proper build-up in distance to give my lower leg muscles the chance to build up properly. It'll be boring but I'm thinking I should double back and follow the proper progression. Does this seem like a good idea? Is there any other advice I should follow? I want to keep running and losing weight, but I don't want to risk any serious injury.

At this point I suspect I *could* go faster since I‚Äôm only training on treadmill, but since I‚Äôm focused building endurance time vs distance I haven‚Äôt pushed the speed faster.

Up until now I've had no problem with the running, other than general lack of fitness. No pain or anything. 

Now though, 12 minutes in my right calf and shin begins to hurt, more and more until I honestly think I am damaging something. When i stop to stretch it out I can't raise my toes to the sky to stretch my calf, I have to manually put my foot against a wall.

After stretching it I usually get another 2-3 minutes out of it before I have to stop again. 

Things I've tried: 

- YouTube led full leg stretches and warm ups
- Rolling a ball against my calf to break up the tissue
- Had my gait filmed at a running shop and they recommended arch support shoes
- bought ¬£100 running shoes that supposedly were to try and alleviate the pain

For reference I use a treadmill and my warm up and cool down speed is set to 3, The incline is always set to 3 and when I start jogging I set it to 5. One problem I will admit is that on week 4 day 3 I changed my breathing technique while running to only breathing in through my nose.

I'm a slow runner anyway and sometimes I feel like if I walked a fast pace it would be equal to my running speed. I just feel so heavy and to run for 5 mins is not possible for my size and shape.  I am just praying for the voice telling me to walk again. I wonder if physically I'm at my limit or if it's the mental thing making it so hard this week.

While everyone writes ‚Äògo as slow as you can"", there are just as many posts and comments about how folks are ""only"" running a 9-10 minute mile and how slow they feel.  

I did this program and ""finished"" it a year ago today, running for 30 minutes - not 5k. In fact, I wasn‚Äôt close to 5k.  I had struggled with the idea of how ‚Äòslow‚Äô I was the entire 8 weeks.  My speed and how hard it was to get to that 30 minutes, and how much longer I‚Äôd need to run to get to 5k. I gave up. I never ran a 5k.

I‚Äôve been back on the program for about 5 weeks now. I‚Äôm using a different app, which doesn‚Äôt use distance, it just uses time. Mentally that makes a difference for me. I‚Äôve stopped caring about how fast I‚Äôm going.  I‚Äôm focused on the long term endurance. I‚Äôm actually using a 10k program this time so I can continue to have goals for 4 months. 

And I go slow.  REALLY slow. Jogging at 3.5 mph slow. Slower than just about any other post I‚Äôve seen on here. And you know what?  It works for me. I did 20 minutes 2 days ago and 25 minutes today. I kept my heart rate in the right range for my age.  I didn‚Äôt finish feeling like I was dying, or that I never wanted to do it again.  In fact, I felt like there was room to continue to grow. I felt like this is what it‚Äôs supposed to feel like. 

So go slow...  Don‚Äôt be intimidated by what or how other people are doing. Find your speed.  Don‚Äôt go so hard that you hate it or dread it every day, or that you‚Äôll finish the program and give up.  

5k is an arbitrary number. Does it really matter in the end if it takes you 8 weeks or 8 months to run a 5k? For me it doesn‚Äôt. I came here to learn to run and to improve my cardio, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.",C25K,1583210601,staypuppy,26,1,True,2020-03-02

80,Recommendations for staying safe from aggressive dogs?,"W8D2

So I was attacked by a dog while on my run today....on the sidewalk in a residential neighborhood. I was only bitten once on the hand, and not very deeply, but if a passerby had not stopped their car to allow me to jump in, it could have been so much worse. 

According to the dog‚Äôs owner, he accidentally left the garage door open when he left for work, and the dog was caring for her litter of 5 week old pups in the garage.  

The dog in question was a 30-40 lb female pit bull.  She may have thought she was simply defending her pups, but I was terrified.  According to the police officer that responded to my call, I was the second person attacked by her this afternoon, and I was the lucky one. The other victim was treated in the ER for deep bites on the thigh. 

The police officer said pepper spray/bear spray isn‚Äôt very effective for dog attacks.  Short of carrying a gun, what suggestions do you have for situations like this?  I certainly can‚Äôt outrun a medium/large dog.",C25K,1583297893,Aevynnn,10,1,True,2020-03-03

90,Week 5- mindset shift,"I just finished W5D3 and am amazed at some of the mental changes I‚Äôm seeing now vs when I did this program 8 years ago. I have kids, work, and household responsibilities now that make it harder to get a consistent time to run. I realized in the middle of last week that getting my run in on Monday would be tough (W5D2) due to a packed schedule and that bothered me. I knew I needed to run, but more than that, I WANTED to run. 

I began looking at options to move things around and see if I could make it work in my schedule. I ended up having to do the run after the kids were in bed.  I had made poor food choices over the weekend and was feeling sluggish. I knew the run would be hard (later runs are hard for me anyway). Still, not doing the run or pushing it out a day simply wasn‚Äôt an option in my mind. As I suspected, I struggled with the run and couldn‚Äôt complete it perfectly (needed to walk a couple of times during the second run interval). Still, I knew WHY the run wasn‚Äôt ideal and didn‚Äôt beat myself up for it.

Today was W5D3 and I wasn‚Äôt confident I‚Äôd be able to run 20 minutes straight. The first 10 went okay, but I was definitely watching the clock during the last 5 minutes to see how much longer I had to go. I kept going and got it done and didn‚Äôt feel horrible (but no way I would have made it another 5 minutes lol). The relief that came with hitting that 20 minute mark was immense.

I share all this because I remember beating myself up for not doing things perfectly last time I did the program. I was so focused on getting it ‚Äúright‚Äù that I couldn‚Äôt see the progress I was making. I couldn‚Äôt accept that I would have ‚Äúoff‚Äù days. And honestly I would have used the busy schedule as a reason to take a day or three more off than I should, and it would have slowed my progress. Seeing my internal commitment to keep going, make it happen, accept the progress, and show myself grace for imperfections (while trying to figure out how to make it better in the future) is encouraging. 

We all have reasons we are doing this and reasons we think we aren‚Äôt good enough. I just want to encourage everyone to give themselves some love and grace and appreciate the growth on the journey, and to trust that you will eventually reach your goals even if it takes longer than you‚Äôd like.",C25K,1583361451,jenius0123,3,1,True,2020-03-04

20,Postponed my run today,"When I started out on C25K, I would sometimes post-pone runs because I didn't feel like getting out of bed, or it was too cold, or I wasn't feeling 110%. As I progressed, I started to enjoy the runs more and more. I went from dreading W5D3 to managing W6D3 and actually enjoying W7D1!

This morning I was planning to do W7D2. I had gotten up, dressed, the whole shebang. It was cold, so I put some more layers ready to put on when I go out. I prefer to warm up inside, so I don't spend 5ish minutes warming up my legs while the rest of my body is cooling down. I do my warm-up, my stretches to get loose. With the final 2 exercises, high knees and butt kicks, the pain starts.

Every time my left leg hits the ground, I feel a sharp pain in the inside of my lower left leg. I shifted how I landed on my foot, I massaged the spot shortly, nothing helped. I think that maybe it'll vanish when I get going. Extra layers go on, cat gets a pat on the head, and I take the 5 steps to the front door. I'm not walking those steps, I'm hobbling. I massage again, the pain is worse. I test another few steps, I am actively needing to relieve the leg from the pain.

I'm torn. I really wanted to go for a run! Hesitantly, I take off the extra layers. Suddenly, I realise I am talking myself down. I am working to convince myself that I need to rest to prevent this pain from becoming an injury. 

That was themoment  when I suddenly realised this program does more than take you to 30 minutes of running. It takes you to 30 minutes of running that you enjoy. I am now so excited to hit the final week, so excited to see when I hit my first 5k. But I have to be careful too; if I don't listen to my body, I'll be waiting a whole lot longer to get to those goals. 

Besides, the trail will still be there tomorrow, and now, so will I.",C25K,1582040235,NearTheWater,1,1,True,2020-02-18
22,Thank you in advance - you're all an inspiration to me!,"Apologies for the ramble. This subreddit is an answer to prayer. 

I am a man in my 20s, 6 ft/1.8 m tall, weigh 198 lbs/90 kg. Yesterday was my fourth ""1st day at the gym"" of 2020 due to physical and mental health issues. Last year I did a workout program with some coworkers where the gym owner kindly and gently pressured me towards focusing on weight lifting. However, I couldn't stay motivated to go back to the gym after the program was over because I've never really cared about being big and bulky and have always enjoyed being a cardio and long distance warrior. I mowed yards in high school for a living, which meant at age 16 I had the body of a cross-country runner. This morning I realized the gym program is long over, so I can decide for myself if I want to focus on lifting weights or doing high cardio. I've decided I want to try to, as much as reasonably possible, get back to my 16 year old physique.

There is an annual summer 5k I've always wanted to run in. I've tried the C25k program several times over the last few years but have always ended up with shin splints or knee pain. This morning I found this subreddit. After seeing all of the people who, respectfully, are much bigger or much older than me knocking it out week after week, I realize I've got no excuses. I've got the health, the resources to do it right, and I finally have the money to afford running shoes.

I downloaded the C25K app again. This weekend I am going shoe shopping. I plan to start on Monday.

So thank you all for helping me get to this point. And if I could ask for some advice on the mental aspect... I come from an obese family. I put a lot of pressure on myself to stay skinny. I know that when I start I'm going to be prone to tell myself to run more or run faster so I can be skinny and not be like my family. In my head I know I'm only slightly overweight, but in practice I have a hard time believing that. Any advice on how to overcome this would be greatly appreciated.

61,Did my first day. Need to commit! Looking for success stories for motivation.,"I‚Äôve gained almost 50 pounds since my relationship turned marriage. I was really into health and fitness during college. Got down to 110 and was thinner than I was in high school. I was at 120-125 when I graduated college (5 years ago). I gained some due to stress of starting my career, life etc. At the time 120/125 felt big (I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2‚Äù) but now I would do anything to be back! 


Then came relationship weight. Lost some for the wedding. But it all came back and even more. stress anxiety and depression over life and.. weight gain. It seems like every time I try to lose it, I go too hard which makes me quit and then binge eat and gain more!!! Terrible cycle. 

Anyway I decided to start c25k because I need some cardio but I like the routine/goals/feeling of accomplishment each day that is completed. Always wanted to be a runner too.

62,Looking for some motivation/success stories. Completed my first day today!,"I‚Äôve gained almost 50 pounds since my relationship turned marriage. I was really into health and fitness during college. Got down to 110 and was thinner than I was in high school. I was at 120-125 when I graduated college (5 years ago). I gained some due to stress of starting my career, life etc. At the time 120/125 felt big (I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô2‚Äù) but now I would do anything to be back! 


Then came relationship weight. Lost some for the wedding. But it all came back and even more. stress anxiety and depression over life and.. weight gain. It seems like every time I try to lose it, I go too hard which makes me quit and then binge eat and gain more!!! Terrible cycle. 

Anyway I decided to start c25k because I need some cardio but I like the routine/goals/feeling of accomplishment each day that is completed. Always wanted to be a runner too.

81,One year since my W1D1,"I (in my early 50s) started c25k a year ago this week, finished it 9 weeks later, and I'm still running.

I never would have finished if it weren't for my running buddies (2- &amp; 4-legged), Peer pressure can be a positive thing!

We did it at the local park. Every time I go there, I still remember how daunting it was at the start to think I'd be expected to run a WHOLE LAP (500m) soon ... and how satisfying when I did.

And I remember how scary it was in the weeks when the running times suddenly increased. Run for TWENTY MINUTES? I only managed that because my co-runners were still going, and I wasn't going to stop if they didn't.

I learned that proper running shoes make a big difference (bought some in W9, d'oh)

After I'd finished c25k and I started running on the road, I learned how much easier that was than the grass at the park.

During c25k I wondered if when/if I'd be able to run our 8k dog walk around the fields. Turns out it was only a few weeks after W9 ... kept the speed at an easy jog and just kept going.

That was when I learned how useful it was to have an out-and-back route, rather than laps of a small park. Much harder to give up early!

After finishing C25K we started going to parkrun, which are much more fun. I learned the best way to improve your parkrun personal best is to find one on a flatter course üôÇ

I also learned that summer running gear gives quite a bit of extra pace over winter gear!

A few times last year, when friends and family heard I'd started running, they asked if I was planning to do longer runs when I'd finished c25k. I didn't have the slightest inclination to go further, couldn't *imagine* why anyone would want to do that, but ... this winter the runs were getting a bit dull, so to give me something to aim for I've entered a half marathon. Turns out they're really easy (to enter üôÇ).

Today's long run is 15k, which is scary to think about. But it's just a bit further than last week, so I'm going to start, and keep going, and see what happens.


And that's the main thing I like about running. Not the act itself, but the feeling of having done it, of being fitter, of having dragged myself out, made myself start, made myself carry on. There isn't a single run where I don't think ""I'm not going to be able to do this today, this was a mistake, I'll stop ... soon. Just a bit further.""",C25K,1582362792,aa599,3,1,True,2020-02-22
84,Dont know whats wrong ..... But today sucked,"A little bit of info about me .... I am 5'7'' and I used to weigh 89 KG (196 pounds) (overweight). Never ran in my whole Life.

Now I weigh 78 KG (171 pounds) still overweight

I gave up this program already once since it is too much for me (Yes even the W1 D1 was too much for me). So I gave up the program and decided to reduce my weight first I took 80k - 120k steps a week for about 5 months or so and with little bit of struggle I lost some weight. 

When I picked up the program again (the previous month), I avoided my previous rookie mistake of speeding. I took it slow . I I kept an eye on my breathing and my pace. My HR was so much better this time and I really enjoyed my little jogs and I was glad I completed week 1 and week 2 .... It didn't feel like a suicide mission anymore but here comes the problem, After taking break for a month due to exams I decided I should redo the week 2 and Went for a jog day before yesterday .... It felt little uncomfortable but I was able to complete it and I had the stamina even after the last 6th run .... So I went ahead and walked for 40 mins more.

But today(with 1 rest day) when I did the same week2 day 2 it felt like hell . During the first jog I can feel the pain from my shins .... I reduced my pace a bit but didn't stop even though I wanted to .  My legs literally gave up at my 6th run and I didn't do the final run. I can feel pain even while walking at snail pace.I literally dragged my self on my feet just reach home. That 30 mins felt like eternity.

I am wondering why did this happen especially when I was so comfortable doing the same run with better pace in the same path. I am totally confused .... 

is this common while running ? (Do people like me need more rest days instead of one day ?)

Is there anything I can do more to enjoy my runs a bit more ?

So yesterday was the day I have been planning all week to do the most difficult run yet, the dreaded 20 minutes. I purposefully didn't go to hard at the gym all week so that I wouldn't be too sore, I made sure I slept enough/ate enough/drank enough water. Tried to cut off all the fucking negative self-talk before hand saying I couldn't do it.¬†  


I came home from work yesterday ready-ish to knock it out. Buuuut. Got outside, my legs felt weird. Off. I was annoyed because I really didn't want to \*have\* to run on a Friday after work. Remembered when I used to hit 7-11 on the way home, grab beer, and immediately start getting shit faced on Friday afternoons, with nothing to look forward to but a little bit of numbness to move past the week. I was annoyed that I actually had to work now, and didn't get that brief mental vacay. I started the run, hesitantly.  And I completed the run.  But I did stop and walk. Probably like 4 or 5 times. None for more than about 20 seconds at a time, but the instructions on this run said very explicitly to, ""Run for 20 minutes without walking."" So I failed.  


I was bummed and disappointed. Came home and consoled myself with two pieces of banana bread and some cheese popcorn while watching the new Ted Bundy docu-series on Amazon. Told myself I could take the rest of the weekend off from working out and reassess on Monday.¬† Went to bed.¬†  


But this morning! I woke up at 7 am (on a Saturday. WTF who am I even?) and the first thought that popped into my head was ""My dude! You can do this!"" So even though it was raining, even though my dog Brenda was super hyper and pulling and bugging me the whole time to stop and pee and smell every damn thing every 2 seconds, even though it was hard and I was scared I couldn't do it...I did it! And I feel amazing! I realize 20 minutes of continuous running isn't like the hugest thing in the world, but for me, it was difficult. I almost gave up and just let my negative self-talk convince me that ""meh, it's not meant to be, I'm not a runner.""¬†But I did it.

I am using the zenlabs c210k app and am currently at week 11. That's three runs of 17 minutes with 1 minute break between each run. With the warm-up and cool-down walk, it's total of 63 minutes. 

I am a 25yo girl, 170cm and 70kg. Due to the cold and rainy weather and my lack of proper winter running clothing, I went back to the treadmill, which wasn't problematic until week 10. That's when I started feeling this pain on the right side my lower back while running, mostly at the final 15 minutes of the run. It's kind of like a sharp stabbing pain that's bearable, but makes the run harder and elevates my heart rate. Has anyone experienced something similar? 

Apart from that, it seems that my running shoes (adidas cloudfoam) started feeling tighter and are hurting my feet (especially the right one), which wasn't an issue when I was training for the 5k. I don't know whether my feet swell up due to the longer run, or are the sneakers just not that good for a longer run. Should I look for new sneakers?

There might be more questions where these came from, but I have just returned from a very hard 7k run and need to take a shower :) Honestly, apart from these two questions, I will take any solid advice for a 5k to 10k transition. What else do you think I should know?

P.S. Good luck to all of you guys, I can't describe how proud I am for all of you. You don't know me, but trust me - if I managed to do the 5k, you can do it too. I was hopeless, and am now running for almost an hour in total. YOU CAN DO THIS!",C25K,1581181586,I_am_dharma,7,1,True,2020-02-08
24,First post,This is my first post. I've been doing c25k on the run double app since dec 27th.  I made it to week 3 then kinda hit a plateau really struggling. So I went back and am repeating the weeks. I've finally moved back to week 2.  I have never been a runner. I signed up for my first 5k in may with a goal to do a half marathon in october with my husband. He is in much better shape than I'm in. I'm experiencing frustration feeling like I'm not getting faster. My distance tracker is just not moving and I've tried the gym track counting laps and my gps quits because its elevated.  I cant seem to get much over a mile.  My husband says I'm too stuck on what im seeing. But I feel it's easy for him to say as hes on like week 6 running multiples miles.

46,Does fitness from running translate to uphill hiking?,"I enjoy photography and hiking, but I'm currently too out of shape to do long and strenuous hikes. Also when I go hiking with friends, I'm often one of the slowest and people have to wait for me. So one of my main motivations for doing C25K was to increase my fitness so I can do more difficult hikes. I'm on week 7 now and my overall fitness has definitely improved, since I can now run for 2  miles straight and my resting heart rate has decreased too. But I still get out of breath and my legs feel a little sore when I go up a couple flights of stairs. I'm not sure whether this is because the place where I run is mostly flat, or whether it just takes more time to build up fitness for hills.

For my next steps after completing the program, I was wondering whether I should find somewhere else with hills, try the stair climbing machine at the gym, or whether just running longer distances where I am would also help. I don't have a car and don't live with anyone else who has one, so I would probably have to take a bus or Uber to find a different route with hills.",C25K,1581319929,Pbwtpb,2,1,True,2020-02-09

51,Why did you start running?,"I was at a party this weekend, most of which was attended by family who have seen me before and during my weight loss journey. For some background, a year and a half ago I was 325lbs and now I'm closer to the 210lbs range. In the beginning you couldn't force me out of my room to do much of anything, let alone exercise. I wouldn't be caught dead out of bed before noon, that was for sure. But now I'm awake at 6:30 every morning and run 5 days a week. I completed the C25K program back in September and run 5ks pretty frequently.

I was asked multiple times why I started running and I gave the usual reasons. I wanted an exercise I could do anywhere. It just seemed like fun. I wanted to challenge myself. Quick answers that would get them to stop talking about me and deflect the attention away because I hate talking about myself. I don't like attention very much, especially when it comes to my running. I consider myself a novice at running, only up to an 11minute mile. I'm nowhere I want to be, but I'm working on it. I'm self conscious about it and don't like to draw attention to it very much.

But this morning while on my run I was thinking things through and I realized that the real reason I started running was because it was something I never thought I could do in a million years. If you had told me 15 years ago (as I was being forced to run a mile weekly in gym class) that I'd be running 2-3miles daily I'd have thought you were crazy. But now I actually like running and it's something that I look forward to doing.

So I was curious about why others started running, especially with the C25K program. I feel like this is a community with people who wouldn't usually consider themselves runners who turned to it against type.

6,Getting started and keeping going,"Hey runners, I wanted to post this here because I am frequently speaking up on posts trying to prevent people from losing their steam on this program. I wanted to pass on some hard and fast truths of doing C25K and running in general, and I'm hoping I can refer back to this in the future. These are lessons that most of us learn along the way, but there are many, many distractions that can make these things hard to notice.

1. The first thing you need to learn is: Slow Down, like really slow down. Slower than you can walk is ideal, but at least go a lot slower than you think you need to go.
2. Your knees are probably going to start hurting at some point. It's most likely caused by the fact that your quadraceps are getting stronger, but you glutes and hamstrings are not. If you start doing hamstring curls, and walking up stairs backwards when you start the program you can avoid this.
3. It doesn't matter what gear you use to run, just be comfortable, the less shit you have to do before you go for a run, the harder it will be to make an excuse not to go. I didn't have my running shoes at work with me the other day, but I haven't invested hundreds of dollars into shoes so I didn't use that as an excuse not to go, my work shoes are hardy and comfortable enough to run in, so I just went in them.
4. W5D3 is going to sneak up on you and you will be scared, the good news is, that everyone can do this run, it's W6D1 where you have to go back to basics and start with my first point.
5. Don't use this program to lose weight, if you haven't already lost weight and you are trying, start by fixing that first, the high you get from a successful run can sometimes lead to overindulgence",C25K,1580252092,SadieWopen,3,2,True,2020-01-28

16,When do my legs get used to this?,"Hi all, 

I'm new here to C25K, currently on Week 2, Day 2. This week has been feeling much easier than Week 1, apart from the fact that my lower legs (calves and shins) are constantly hurting after a run and have been since W1D2, like really bad pain that I struggle to walk with. The pain starts to ease up after I have my rest day but tends to still be there slightly when it comes to my next run day when it immediately gets worse again. I do other exercises aside from this, such as HIIT classes, Kettlebells, Cycling, Yoga etc. 

I guess my questions are when will my legs stop hurting so much and get used to running, do I have shin splints, and should I take more rest days from running in between runs? Is this normal?

Also, how can I stop my legs from hurting so much?

**November:**  I completed c25k just in time to run a 5-mile / 8km on Thanksgiving this year. Things were going great! I still had to run intervals for some of it, but I felt good pain-wise.

**December**: I ran several times in December (good runs!). A little numbness here and there, but manageable‚ÄîI could push thru it.

**January:** Had my last great run on Jan 7th. Ran 2 miles straight! Felt great about myself. And then I did a 4 mile race in the hilliest bits of Central Park on Jan 12. Both legs started going numb for the first time. I was able to finish in an ok time, but definitely had a lot of trouble. Since then, I haven't been able to have a 'good run' or a run without both legs going numb. I can barely run a mile now.

2. If you‚Äôre training on a treadmill, things are going to be weird when you get out there.

My thought was that for a $20 ""entry fee,"" you get a shirt mailed to you (from a third party company, I wouldn't have your personal information; I've already got this part secured) and that counts as your entry fee-- 100% of the proceeds go toward the nonprofit. You run the 5k and post a picture of you in your T-Shirt on reddit or instagram (or both! I'd make a subreddit) with a quick story of why you participated-- it could be simple, or if willing, you could post something more personal. If you post your official time to Strava and link me, the top 3 (or 10! I'd need to see how much they'd cost as this would come out of my own savings) will have a medal mailed to them :) 

Following the virtual 5k, I'd plan to have a meetup in my city (top 10 biggest in US, fair chance for a handful to show up), where I'd have some of the participants' stories printed out in a display of support for the cancer community. We could chat and enjoy the company of new friends, and if anyone felt so inclined, share our personal stories with one another. 

Any interest? Absolutely happy to share more details in the name of transparency, but for the sake of anonymity, I'm going to withhold until I see that there's a fair amount of interest. Feel free to post or DM me with any questions!",C25K,1579582422,seehunde,0,1,True,2020-01-20

44,In between C25K days...,"Howdy all, I still need to make an accountability thread, but I wanted to ask: what do you all do to keep active on the off-days? I always feel guilty not doing something, but yesterday I did W1D3, I did W1D3 of the 100 pushups app once in the morning and then once in the afternoon (I just felt like my arms didn't feel tired at all!) among other weights. After I did W1D3 of the C25K app in the afternoon, I kept going to finish out the hour and did a full 6km in 60 minutes. I even spent a solid few minutes jogging faster at 5mph (compared to the 4.7mph speed I was doing during the C25K program) just to reach 5km as fast as possible. Obviously I am not at the full jogging stage or better even, running, and that's why I am here! :)  


I'm interested to know what you all do to not feel guilty on off-days. I was thinking maybe riding on a bike for some nice low-impact movement that can flush the lactic acid, that's at least what my dad was suggesting. Since I did so many push ups yesterday and weights, upper body is obviously out for tonight. I'm thinking maybe core exercises and/or stair-master too?

69,Please do not ignore pain/discomfort when running,"I graduated C25k in late November. Since then, I ran 5k three times a week throughout December, then upped to 6k, then upped to 8k, which I now run three times a week.

After my last run, I noticed a lot of tightness and discomfort in my rights knee. Overnight, the discomfort faded, to be replaced with similar feeling down the outside of my leg (the ITB). I was really bummed - I've grown to really love running and what it does for my mental health.

Thankfully, I work for a large company and we have a physio onsite once a week. I booked into see him. Within 5 minutes, he knew what the issue was. My gait when I'm either walking or running is weak on my right leg and draws my knee closer to the other leg, meaning that the abductor muscle is weak and the ITB is overused. This happens regardless of whether I run or walk. But of course, the added impact of running has exacerbated it and started to wear at my knee. He showed me on the sole of my shoe that correspondingly, I was wearing down the tip of my high heel unevenly - showing that I really don't walk 'straight' on my right leg.

Luckily, by coming in the first time I felt it to be an issue, this has been caught and identified super early. I don't have runner's knee, but would have if I continued to try running through the problem. Equally, waiting for it to 'heal' wouldn't work as it's not really damaged - just a bad natural alignment. A couple of stretches made me feel right as rain for the first time since Saturday. I got set away for a specific range of exercises to do before my runs - but I can still run and intend to do so tonight.

I guess my TL;DR is: when something is really painful (not just exhausting, like when we first start the C25k programme) and feels unnatural, go and see someone immediately. Don't waste time trying to self diagnose online, it will never be as accurate or as tailored as someone who has looked at the way you hold yourself.

70,W2D3 and heel pain,"I (29F) just completed week 2 day 3 and noticed every time I struck the ground my heel would feel sore. It‚Äôs not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Similar to a bruise. I try to strike with an even balance on my feet, but that didn‚Äôt help the heel pain. It hurts when I walk too - every time I take a step my heels hurt. Even as I‚Äôm sitting writing this, I feel my heels flaring up.

Should I stop running and see a physio/podiatrist? Attempt to stretch and slow down? I have tried to stretch after running but maybe I haven‚Äôt done the right stretches. I‚Äôve been running at about 6.2-6.5 and it‚Äôs been a struggle to catch my breath. I take long strides too - I don‚Äôt quite have the cadence down yet. I also have a flat left foot/collapsed arch.

37,"Almost quit yesterday, but didn't","For reference im M25, 6'2"" 365lbs  
Started doing C25K this week, I've tried doing it before but never actually completed the first day. Monday I couldn't do the first day ended up walking some of the run sessions then just shut the app and went to a stationary bike. 

Tuesday I completed the whole session and marked the first time since high school of running over a mile, Knocked out Wednesday and felt great about it. 

Then came Thursday, I decided to up my running and walking speed on the treadmill because my sessions haven't been coming out to an actual 5k, averaging 1.4 to 1.7 miles. 

By the third run session I felt the piercing pain in my ribs and back and decided to call it and stop the session. I hit ""Pause"" on the app, then ""quit"", and that last message popped up, ""are you sure you want to quit all session data will be lost"" and for whatever reason, that stopped me and I decided to continue on at lower speeds. 

I am SO happy I didn't quit and have officially completed week 1. I just felt like I had to share my experience, this week I feel like I have ran more now than I ever have after leaving high-school.",C25K,1578691427,slurms_Mckinzy,11,1,True,2020-01-10
38,Happy parkrun eve!,"It's parkrun day tomorrow! Anyone doing one?

For those who done know, parkrun is a free, weekly, timed 5k run or walk that takes place in parks all over the world on Saturday mornings. They're open to everyone from the fastest runners to the slowest walkers.

If you're lucky enough to have one near you, I'd strongly recommend you use it for your next C25K workout. You won't find a friendlier or more supportive running community anywhere!

They're mostly in the UK, Ireland, South Africa and Australia atm but the movement us spreading like mad across North America, Europe and Asia so check and see if you've got a local one!

39,Just registered for my first 5k race,"Hi üëãüèª

I was perusing this subreddit today (after completing W2D2 this afternoon) as I recently started C25K. When journaling my goals for this year, I wanted to run a 5k race in April, figuring 8 weeks of C25K (running outside in the Minnesota winter...that will keep the pace up!) plus a month or so of extra time would put me in a good place to do so.

A bit of history‚Äîfrom 2009-2011, I ran A LOT! My regular runs were 6 miles three times a week plus a long run on the weekends. I started from zero and just kept going, ultimately topping out at 11-12 miles before I became injured and had to back off running. I have run a bit here and there since, and even started C25K, but always somewhere in the middle as I thought starting from W1D1 was too easy. I never finished out the program though (wonder why!?). Anyway, even when I was running longish distances frequently at a good pace, I still felt too slow to join a running club or run in a formal race. Maybe it was because I was 16 or because I had the belief that nothing I did was ever good enough, but I forced myself to be a solo runner. Most of the time this was fine, but sometimes camaraderie is nice, and I continually denied myself that pleasure.

Pardon my French, but fuck that. Maybe it‚Äôs being a bit older and hopefully a teensy bit wiser, but I‚Äôve always wanted to run races and now I‚Äôm going to do just that. I‚Äôve signed up for my first race in April, and am looking forward to putting in the time and effort to get to the starting line. Slow and steady and zero shame about it.

Reading through everyone‚Äôs posts, I‚Äôm inspired by all you who are bettering your lives through running. Virtual high fives all around! I encourage you to do something scary too‚Äîyou deserve to live fully.

Keep on running! I‚Äôll do the same.",C25K,1578702907,natceeemm,2,1,True,2020-01-10

I see posts all the time about the actual program, but what do your other days look like? (I understand the importance of rest days). But when would be a good time to incorporate strength training as well? Do you guys strength train on your run days? Is there other exercises I should look into as well that would aid my running?

It hurt, I struggled, especially my breathing (I sometimes get a touch of asthma) and thought I may give up on the last couple of 60 sec runs, but I did it and felt so good for doing so.

I‚Äôm new to this community, but I‚Äôve seen a lot of positive and uplifting posts! I‚Äôm hoping to take for now/add in the future a little bit of that positivity myself:)

A little background, I‚Äôve had a severe panic disorder since I was 19. It first started when I was lifting heavy weights and I was pushing myself too hard. I bulked up at the expense of being hospitalized for 2 years in and out, thinking I‚Äôm dying from a heart attack which was eventually found out to be a panic attack. I‚Äôm 25 now and throughout the years I‚Äôve learned how to cope, accepting that death is inevitable and using all the mindfulness techniques to bring down the attacks to about a minute long as opposed to the hours on end I had to endure. 

Anyway, sob story aside haha, I‚Äôve always told my family how I‚Äôve longed to run since I turned 21. I used to be a really active kid, always playing soccer or some kind of sport during recess like the rest of you I‚Äôm sure.

I was wondering, I just started walking the last two days - 30 minutes on end. I was wondering what you guys do in between? Last year, I tried something similar but gave up when it came to the jogging part because, in being sedentary for almost 4+ years, I get exhausted, out of breath and anxious. I feel like I‚Äôm living in an elderly man‚Äôs body. I‚Äôm about 6,1 - 130 pounds (very skinny now) and my resting heart rate is about 90.

* When people say go slow; GO SLOW! its not about speed (yet), its about building the cardiovascular and muscle endurance. trust the process.
* quality stretching. look up runners stretches and do them before AND AFTER runs. seems obvious, but I only ever did them before. it makes a huge difference in soreness and shin splint pain.
* be conscious of your breathing.
* running 20 mins non stop was purely mental. If you're made it to week 5 you can definitely do it. it's really mind over matter. push yourself. coming out on the other side knowing that I was able to complete it pumps me up and gets me excited for crushing the 25 min non-stop run. again, trust the process.

30,C25K - Is it really 5K,"I was not planning on doing it today, but pushed a bit further than last week after my spectacular failure with W8D3, and managed to finish, not very fast but I am sure speed will come more time and experience. 

I use Polar to track the entire session including warm-up and cool-down and then used Apple Workouts to track the running part separately. 

So according to C25K I am done, but when I look at the running part and excluding the walking bit the distance is only 4K.

I guess it is not really that important, but just something I noticed, so if you are going to do a run of 5K, and include 5min warm-up and cool-down sessions your total distance will probably be 6km, not 5 as per the app. 

At least it was a beaut of a morning at the beach!

66,Just finished w5d3 for the second time,"I didn't start running quite from couch, but I was a complete couch potato 6 months ago. Started with c25k after 4 months of biking and swimming, so I had a little endurance already. I never liked running much, so the first week of actually doing the intervals without dying in between was incredibly motivating.  
I reached w5d3 (timed), and I was completely bewildered that I actually could run 20 minutes. Then I looked at the distance and was less impressed. Mostly because, in the meantime, I had mouthed off to my boss that I would join the company run (6 km) next year. And I'd barely run 2 km in 20 minutes.  
So I restarted the program from week 3, this time going for distance. And I have to admit it was *much* harder for me, because I can more or less accurately measure 5 minutes, but not really 500 m. It's getting a bit easier now that I know my pace. I'm a dwarf, so I'll probably never set any speed records, so going for more distance feels quite satisfying, too.

Last week, I was helping a friend find some running resources and was tapping through content from @littlelyssfitness on IG and she mentioned something about cramps and increasing intensity too quickly. Suddenly, it all clicked. Although everything else felt fine, great even, my cramps were probably because I pushed too hard, too quickly.

35,Running Outdoors vs on a Treadmill,"TLDR at the bottom.  
So I've been working on C25K for the past couple of months. I had to take a week off 3 weeks ago as I was ill, but then I jumped right back into where I'd left off. That week I finished week 7 day 1 and 2. They were tough, but I finished them. I missed the last session of that week, and I've missed one or two more since as I'm on vacation. However, today I decided to try and get into it and as I don't have access to a treadmill right now, I decided to run outdoors. 

I couldn't even make it 0.25miles before I had to stop and walk for a little bit. I could easily run for 25 minutes on a treadmill at a pace of 9-9.5kmh so I was surprised I was struggling so much outdoors. I thought perhaps my pace was too quick, so after walking for a couple of minutes I set out at a jog again, this time slower than I did before, but to the same result. I kept this up for 45 minutes wherein I covered 2.7 miles, but the majority of it was me walking. I just can't figure out why I was struggling so much and what I need to do to improve at running outdoors. Has anyone else experienced this, and do you have any advice on adapting to running outdoors?

TLDR: Does anybody else find running on a treadmill much easier than running outdoors? and does anyone have any tips on adapting from one to the other?",C25K,1576181140,Casual_Motion,7,1,True,2019-12-12

57,W5D3 done but suuuuuuper slow.,"I'm doing the C210K app as i signed up for a 10K (in Jan) on a whim (as they didn't have 5K). I figured having a goal like that would be the only way I would train to run - something I've been meaning to do for a while. The idea was to start from week 2 and atleast make it to week 11 doing a program a day (6x a week) as opposed to 3x a week - I signed up at the beginning of Dec, so i have 5ish weeks total to train. 

Today was W5D3 - I knew this all week but somehow indulged in laziness and skipped a few days. I woke up this morning knowing I had to complete W5D3 to be on schedule for the training and waddyaknooo - I jogged slow but it was steady, I didn't feel tired. Set myself small goals like - ""make it to 10 mins first"", then ""what's 5 more going to do?"" and finally the last 5 for which - ""you've done 5 min runs mutiple times before"". Talking to myself and breaking it down really helped. 

Also completed W5D2 after D3 with a 30 min walk in between. This is cause im trying to do multiple programs if I can in a day - cause I try to get in 7.5-8K (so my body gets used to the distance? I think that's my logic) - even if I have to walk to complete the distance.

I've been following the subreddit for a while now and was quite anxious about today. If I can do it at just over 100kg, 5ft 5, anyone can. In case you're being hard on yourself for something, missed a few days, lacking motivation, waiting for the ""right time"" to begin/restart,  just show up for yourself. Take one step. Then take another. And keep going. 

We'll be waiting right here to hear all about it! :)

58,"Just finished week 9, run # 2 (adapting c25k to suit my needs)","Hi

I have been doing couch to 5 km for about six months. It‚Äôs taking so long because I have a history of lung problems (chronic lung disease as a child, born prematurely) and very weak joints. So I was doing each week two or three times to gradually build up my fitness. This was very frustrating! 

I have just had to have six weeks off running because I twisted my ankle badly walking down a hill (!) and today I decided to do one of week 7 as a warm up, and then the day I am up to. I do a lot of walking to and from work so I tend to have a fairly good fitness base. 

I said to myself that if week 7 was too hard on my ankles and lungs (cold weather makes it worse, and we had sleet and snow yesterday) that I would just do a long walk or maybe do week 3 or something. But week 7 was okay! 

So I did week 9. Beautiful day here - sunny and cold, blue skies... it was hard but not impossible. 

However, after the 30 minutes, I had only done 4km. I obviously run very slowly. I was so proud but finding it hard to still be proud of myself now :( if I go much faster, I struggle to get any sort of breathing pattern, and I will probably black out.

66,Any suggestions for very obese person who wants to start on C25K?,"Hi Everyone,

I am new member in this sub and am very fat person ( 32M / 118 KG / 5ft 6 inch height ) who is looking forward to start on C25K journey. I already read about what a 2 month plan look like and saw a video or 2 on YouTube but that information came from people who were not as fat as myself.

My Background -
I have been obese my whole life but i don't consider myself very inactive / lethargic ( at least that's how i think ) but at same time i don't have experience of any exercises. I have an office job so i pretty much spend 9ish hours everyday sitting at desk. I don't suffer from any joint pains or medical conditions like blood pressure. But doctors have warned me that I need life style changes and need to reduce weight. In fact, i have had this self realisation from quite some time now but lack mental strength to follow right path for long term. With some loosely followed intermittent fasting i have lost 10 KG since July this year. I enjoy walking, it helps reducing my stress. Based on my step stats captured via mobile, My daily walking average from last 2 years has been 6+ KM per day. Apart from walk involving mundane activities, i pretty much walk for 1 hour at medium pace for 4-5 days per week. But i haven't attempted running like in ages ( 15 ish years at least ) and play no sports apart from occasional badminton.

Feedback required -
In spur of the moment i signed for 5K race scheduled in 1st week of Feb 2020 and i don't want to complete that whole race just by walking.
- Do you guys think, with my weight, should I attempt running ? IRL people have different opinions on this matter and I am little scared ( and very excited ) with idea of running at my weight.
- If yes, what should my C25K plan look like? Whether 2 months are enough to be ready?
- I hate going to gym/weight training but are there any exercises that i can/should perform at home as part of plan?
- any activity that will help recovery from soar joints or leg pain ?
- what are some red flags or negative points that I should be aware about wherein i should stop and  consider about pursuing the plan?

Obviously, I know without putting effort there will be no change but probably I am just looking for little push, knowledge/experiences from community here.

I have 20 years of lifting heavy objects as my main form of exercise and now that I'm on week 4 of C25K, I have about 4 weeks of cardio to my name.

My usual pacing (using a treadmill because the area around me is frosting over) is a 3.5 MPH walk and a 6 MPH jog. Weeks 1 through 3 were challenging but fun! I felt like I was really progressing--and my brain latches on to goals, so 6 MPH meant I'd cross the 10 minute mile, 10 minutes without stopping, and a mile without stopping all at once.

I have been active six days a week for the past six months. I do a strength-training program three days a week and ride a stationary bike for 50 minutes three days a week. I have a BMI of 20.5 so it's not a weight issue.

This post is solely a rant, I'm just really disappointed that my body has decided it will NOT run without a fight. I thought I was doing everything right, I waited until I was in good shape with a decent cardio base and I read everything I could to be prepared. I thought I'd be able to do the program like everyone else I see on here.

I'm almost certain that my stride/form is bad (I think I'm a heel striker) so I will work on that, along with foam rolling. If neither of those helps, I'll look into proper running shoes (the ones I have now are the cheapest available, I'm on a very tight budget so I was hoping I could get away with it).

50,I'm a new runner. Does it make sense starting C25K midway?,"So I'm a 28 yo 173cm 185lbs guy and have been wanting to lose weight for a while. My goal weight is somewhere around 160lbs. Anyway I used to play some sports/swim as a child but I haven't run or worked out in 10 years now. 

I recently moved to a apartment complex with a gym and have been working out for 9 days now. I usually hit the treadmill at the beginning. My first day was painful and I couldn't run more than 2 minutes nonstop at 8kmph pace. However over the past 9 days, I have gradually gotten better and can now run 17-18 minutes nonstop at 8kmph. I usually wear a fitness band to track my footsteps and generally try to add 400-500 steps over the previous day but today I forgot to wear it. So I decided to open C25K app on my phone in the gym. As I was looking at the program, I thought it didn't make sense to start from week 1 day 1 since I felt I could do better so I put the week 4 day 3 program and got going. I finished it easily with plenty left in the tank. 

Now I'm wondering if it is okay to continue doing the program and do the week 5 day 1 next time or should I start from the beginning. My ultimate goal is to lose weight, get leaner and maybe complete a 10K next year. Any advice would be helpful!",C25K,1574614661,desi_derp,4,1,True,2019-11-24

77,Some possible inspiration for struggling people,"I've always hated running. Getting out of breath felt like the start of a panic attack, which sometimes made me panic and actually have a panic attack. I'd tried to learn to like it, and started (and failed) C25K twice. This summer, I decided to give it one last try. My boyfriend, who has run half marathons without training and is super fit, came with me as moral support. In the beginning, at the end of the one minute run, it felt like I would cough out my lungs. I truly felt like I would never get there. I sometimes would repeat a workout 2-3 times before managing to complete it. Life events have sometimes made it possible to run only once a week, I even sometimes had to stop running for a couple of weeks. But this tome, I never gave up! I'm now at W6R2 and I finally am confident that I can do this, I will finish it. My goal is to run my first 5K before December 31st. Yes, it will have taken me 6 months do complete a 2 months program. But when I look at where I started (litterally crying while running at some points because of how hard it was) I am so proud of myself. 

So this is a message for anyone scared of starting, scared of failing, or needing a bit of hope and encouragement: be kind with yourself, and just keep going. Skipping a workout, or even a few weeks does not mean you have given up, or failed, or have to start from 0 again. A workout being to hard to complete the first time around does not mean you suck and you'll never be able to do it. Look at your own abilities, your own progress, be proud of yourself and keep going. It's as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one. 

Some tips that have helped me (especially after I temporarily moved abroad for work and had to run by myself in a cold climate, so I was all alone to run): 
1) Listen to something that will take your mind off of running like a podcast or an audiobook. This helps with the mental challenge of it all. And only allow yourself to listen to it when you run, this will be an extra motivator to go running. 
2) Get a membership at a gym if you can. Running on a treadmill means not worrying about uneven footing, getting lost, the weather, etc. 
3) Talk about it with friends. I sent snaps and messages before and after running to my bf and a close friend who knew how challenging was for me. They gave me tons of encouragement and congratulation and also helped keep me accountable. 
4) Track your progress (I write down the speeds I've run at and for how long, and take a picture of the workout summary shown on the treadmill after I'm done running).

Should I cycle in legs in my  weight training now. What exercises will help my running? Should I go to 10k program or run 5k and focus on getting stronger legs?

This posts [here](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Versa-Smartwatches/Distance-on-GPS-map-doesn-t-match-with-exercise-summary/td-p/3825328) and [here](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Inspire-Inspire-HR/Fitbit-and-quot-Connected-GPS-quot-the-biggest-scam/m-p/3872423/highlight/true#M15882) on the Fitbit forum explains the issues fully but the gist is (from what I understand) is that Fitbit distances when you run or do anything are calculated purely from stride length and not the connected GPS.  If you import your data into Strava or similar you can use Strava to calculate the correct distance from the GPS route rather than the distance Fitbit sends it.  From what I've read the GPS is only used to create the map on the Fitbit, not work out the distance.  It seems a lot of people have been checking their distances and found them way off to varying degrees 

 I've noticed some of my runs which show up as 5Km on Fitbit app showing up less on Strava (and some slightly more) so not sure whats going on

Fortunately I treated myself to a Garmin Vivoactive 3M since which seems to be spot on so definitely running 5km+ now

65,It gets easier,"I'm only a week away from finishing up the C25K program and after my run tonight and the slight runner's high I had post work out I began to reflect on my journey.

At the beginning of the year I was the heaviest I had ever been at 253lbs and like every other year I said this would be the year that I get into shape and little did I know at the time it would work out! 

After trying out tons of different programs, in June, I finally settled on C25K and at first every run felt like I was dying and my heart and lunges were going to explode out of my chest. I could only do one run per week due to my crazy construction work schedule too and that did not help.

I kept pushing though and with each run I felt less like dying and more like enjoying what I was doing. Then finally around September my project finished and I could run more often. I signed up with Real Appeal because I needed someone to keep me accountable diet wise and since then I have been shredding the lbs off my body. 

I got real down though about a month ago because I was struggling so much with the longer runs, it took me 9 repeated days until I could finally finish the full 20minute run and then again it took me multiple tries to finish the 25minute run. It was tough but with each run it was getting easier to run longer. 

Now here I am in my final week of the program and I'm loving it and I'm feeling so much about my health, my body, my weight and its so nice to walk up a flight of stairs and not be one who is out of breath. I'm 35lbs down for the year with time to still drop some more! 

You've got this guys! We are a wonderful community here and just remember on those hard days everyone else here was once in the same boat as you. We've had those tough days where we wanted to quit but like me and others here we're proof that the program works and it gets easier with each run!",C25K,1573701872,ArcherGunnar,1,1,True,2019-11-13

Just a year ago, I was able to run 10km 4 times a week and I was weighting about 90kg, then something happent and I got lot more lazier than I should have been, which resulted in my weight gain.

I often run with two buddies and while I was regressing they were progressing and willing to do the next run in the program. My buddies were telling me it was normal and that my work (lots of walking) was just getting to me. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt do it and that in was holding them back, so I quit. 
Last Sunday I decided to give it a go again. I decided to try w5d1 and it was fine! I was so surprised and happy. Today I went out for w5d2 and I am proud to have completed the run :) 
Basically everyone, don‚Äôt give up! But if you need a break take it, you won‚Äôt loose all your progress!",C25K,1573037179,tinyadipose,6,8,True,2019-11-06
87,Finished Program - Moved onto 10K - Almost Finished then lost Motivation,"I started C25K in February and got through it in fits and spurts around July.  At the time I started my daughter was around 5 months old and I thought this was a great way to fit in exercise with my schedule and tackle my fear of running.  I eventually found a groove and was able to fit in run days two or three times a week.  When I finished the 5k I felt good and ready for a new challenge.  

I moved on to the C210K app and started progressing.  The upside and downside is that the runs get longer and it's more of a time commitment.  I had also started a new job where the only time I could run was early in the morning.  I got as far as week 13 day 3 with one 30 minute interval, a 1 minute break, then another 30 minute interval.  I was on the cusp of the 10k and then things started to go sideways.  

I started to lose motivation.  I had nearly accomplished my next goal, but actually doing it got me scared and I kept putting it off.  My daughter also stared half day preschool/daycare and started to bring home every disease and virus she could and I spend more time in September and October with a cold or other ailment rather than healthy.  

I just can't seem to get myself excited to get out and run again.  I want to keep going and I don't want to lose the progress I've made, but I'm in motivational funk.  I know I'll sometimes enjoy the run, but always enjoy the satisfaction of running.  I'm having issues just taking the steps to get out there.  It's cold in the morning too, which isn't helping.

50,Casual Runner pace after completing C25K,"39M. I have completed C25K a couple of times and I've now run 1400km in 3 years, but I've continually struggled with what I should be doing with my pace and types of runs follow on from graduating.

After finishing C25K I've kept running 3 (or 4 ) times a week at 5k distances but treated every run with a reasonable effort to aim for a 30 minute 5km goal, which I have achieved (but no longer can). My running schedule has almost always been:

* Tuesday 5k (now 7k)
* Thursday 5k (now 7k)
* Saturday Parkrun 5k (latest time 30:07, pb 29:33)
* Sunday Occasionally 10k

After about 1400km of running I'm now seeing advice that I should be running at much slower speeds using heart rate zones. However I'm not sure if this applies to a casual runner, like me, who is not in training and only running to get fit and actually do some exercise. The advice I've seen recommends running most of my time in Heart Rate Zone 2, which has me running a 5k in 40 minutes. My garmin and Strava both tell me these are very light effort workouts and often have recovery estimates of 12 hours, occasionally nearing 24 hours, but I have 48-72 hours between most of my runs.

I've been doing this for 2 months and it seems like I'm getting a gradual decline in my fitness after an initial increase. At first I struggled to even run in this Heart Rate Zone and had to walk occasionally. Eventually I tuned into being able to run slow enough, but gradually the my pace has been decreasing from around 7:30/km to 8:00/km while keeping within the zone 2.

Due to the short distances I run I don't have any time to do anything that isn't a slow marathon shuffle (a friend of mine saw me running recently and said ""you're not really running, it's basically walking like an old man"") so I never get a chance to really stretch my legs and run how it feels more natural to me. I've even stopped treating parkrun as a race because I'm not currently doing a Sunday long run and I'm trying to build up the amount of base miles.

I am a goal driven person, so while I'm not in training to win races, aiming for things like 30 minute 5k times drives me to keep at running, so slow running, or declining performance doesn't help to encourage me to keep running.

&gt;!QUESTION!!!!&lt;

So, my question really is... should a casual runner like me be running all of my runs at this much reduced rate? Is it of any benefit to me when I have such low mileage and I'm not training for a particular event? Is there anything else I should be doing instead?

Sorry for rambling.

Note: My zones are using LTHR zones using an estimate. I have not been lab tested. I tried MHR, HRR and LTHR. MHR zones just felt much too low for me. LTHR and HRR both came out similar so I used them.",C25K,1571812813,mattjhussey,3,3,True,2019-10-22

17,Finished Week 6 and running is much easier!,"Hi there /r/c25k!

This is my first post here. I've been lurking here for the last two months, quietly enjoying the discussion. Thank you all for sharing and sending good vibes :) I've just completed Week 6 Run 3 a few minutes ago. Between running, being on keto, and intermittent fasting I've dropped 14 pounds since the start of September - which my wife has been super happy about. I've mostly been running at night to get some introvert time; and it also helps me to feel more anonymous/invisible. 

I still can't believe that I just ran 22 minutes nonstop!!  But what's harder for me to believe was that running seems to have suddenly ""clicked"" and was not nearly such a challenge this week.

For the first five weeks - I was winded at the end of each running segment and really needed to catch my breath during each walking break. Up until now Strava tells me I've been averaging between 6:30-7:00 minutes per km - I haven't deliberately been trying to go fast or slow - it's just the pace that feels right and that I automatically seem to fall into. I'd try my best to control my breathing at the start of each run, but pretty soon I'd be gasping and taking one breath per stride. I'd be counting down the seconds until each running segment was done. And while W5D3 was crazy tough, but I wasn't about to give up. 

This week, as I started Week 6, running suddenly got \*much\* physically easier. All of a sudden I found that I was able to control my breathing (one breath in for every two steps, and one breath out every two steps). I wasn't winded at all. My legs felt fine. I wasn't struggling to run. I felt I could go on forever. It was as though my body suddenly was fine with running and I felt that I could go longer each run. I wasn't winded or dead at the end. In fact, when I heard the ""last minute"" warning at the end of today's run I **sped up** because I wanted to get to the end of the block before finishing the run... I've never voluntarily done that before! Wtf???

Is this an expected ""shift"" during C25K?

Now, while the runs this week were physically easier, they also felt way mentally harder. I don't know how to explain it. It wasn't that I was thinking that I wanted to stop... It's just that they are long runs, a touch boring, and difficult. I feel like I'm developing mental fortitude? Was this your experience as well? Up to now I've been listening to hiker podcasts and rainy mood (a neat app with a recording of a thunderstorm/rain that helps me mentally space out) to help keep me mentally distracted during runs. I've tried to listen to music occasionally but I found it really hard to maintain a pace and breathe regularly with music. 

I did not expect this change at all, and I'm super jazzed about it. Today's the first day I felt like a runner.

Thank you all so much!",C25K,1570761345,alexre1,0,23,True,2019-10-10

23,Overcoming Week 5 Run 3 20 minute run,"I am currently completing the hugely popular Couch to 5K running program created by Josh Clark. And I have gotten to what seems to be the largest run of the series - Week 5 Run 3 (W5R3) - *20 Minutes*.

I am analytical so I created an effort chart that I think is worth sharing for those that have the same dread. It shows that the real jump in effort was Week 4, when effort increased by 25% over the previous run. W5R3 is only an 8% increase compared with the previous run.

I hope that hope that helps others.

27,W8D3...I did it!,"So, I‚Äôve been writing and amending this for a long time in my head. I‚Äôve been waiting to Graduate to give a full account of my experience and today...I did just that!

This was my second attempt at C25K, the first attempt petered out around week 3. I have since learned a bit about psychology, the human reward system and how I could tackle it properly.

On day 1, I smashed through both W1D1 &amp; W1D2. It was ALL uphill. I ‚Äúburned my bridges‚Äù and knew I was going to do it no matter what. A strong start has massively helped as it felt AWFUL! Since then, I have run every other day, bar one day that I had to skip due to illness. I told myself I was going to do it. Failure is not an option. Some runs felt easy, some felt horrific...one foot in front of the other, switch and repeat. I never looked at distance or pace or anything. My goal was simple. Keep running!

Here‚Äôs my recipe for success...bearing in mind...it‚Äôs ALL opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Don‚Äôt watch the clock. Commit to putting one foot in front of the other...no matter about speed etc.  
 
* Use the audio prompts ONLY!   
 
* Listen to the correct tempo of music with how quickly you run and make it stuff you LISTEN to. It helped me focus elsewhere than the searing pain in my legs and chest.   
 
* Talking of searing pain‚Ä¶I suffered from shin splints before so GET GOOD SHOES!  
 
* Don‚Äôt worry about speed. Having graduated I now have a new goal And am glad I‚Äôm not at the end of my journey. It has become important to me to run so having something to keep working towards is great! Having finished today‚Ä¶I can say for sure it‚Äôs not about the speed you are running it is all about getting you into the right head space to just keep going. Overcoming the urge to stop running.  
 
* I ran fasted every day. Never done it any other way but intermittent fasting is a part of my lifestyle and I feel it gives me more energy. If you are on a weight loss journey I recommend looking at IF. It‚Äôs not for everyone so...take this with a pinch of salt.   
 
* CELEBRATE YOUR WINS! A massive part of this is feeling good but the very nature of C25K is gradual progression. It makes it very hard to get that rush of endorphins you deserve. Well, you only ran a little bit more...right? Wrong, you stuck to a goal...celebrate it. I genuinely set ‚ÄúBulls on Parade by RATM‚Äù on my headphones the second I got that last beep. I would walk down the middle of the street and try and FEEL powerful! 

Most of all...enjoy it. Go slow as you like but...‚Äùone foot in front of the other...keep going‚Äù! 

P.S. For me it wasn‚Äôt about weight loss but; I practise intermittent fasting so don‚Äôt eat until 5 p.m. on any given day and stop eating by 9 p.m. using C25K and IF I‚Äôve dropped 16 lbs of fat, no lean muscle loss and I feel brilliant!",C25K,1570810291,jonnysumthing,1,9,True,2019-10-11

**W1D1 (two days ago):** I started out thinking, ""if this is too easy, maybe I'll run a few extra intervals."" By run 5/8 that had changed to, ""don't stop, don't stop, you can run as slow as you want but *just don't stop* oh my god how is it this hard?""

**W1D2 (today):** Easy peasy! Still had gas in the tank after run 7/8. I easily could have done some more, but I've decided to learn both halves of last week's lesson. :-) So I ran 8/8 at the same pace as 1/8. 

I was wiped out and really didn't feel good after Sunday's run, but today (even with the weather 10 degrees hotter) I'm energized. What a difference that single day has made! It felt amazing starting that last run and feeling fine, remembering what a struggle it had been just two days ago.

94,Did W7D1 and graduated from the program!,"After starting my journey on July 22 with week 1 day 1, I have managed to run for 33 minutes straight on what should have been week 7 day 1!

I have learned so much about running and myself from this community. I started running as fast as I could, which worked to a point. Then I had to run 3 minutes and simply could *not* do it. It took me three weeks to get past week 3.

I learned this is a program about stamina, not speed. I slowed waaaay down even though I felt horrible about seeing my already slow 12 minute mile turn into a 14:30 minute mile. I felt like I was back in middle school running with all the slow kids who didn't care about gym class. But I cared this time! I felt it wasn't fair that my mile was so slow.

But I completed my 3 minutes. Then I was able to do 5 minutes easily. Then 8 minutes. I realized I could do 30 minutes and not feel like I was dying the whole time.

Oh, also, I learned about breathing. Deep breaths with my diaphragm. I find myself recentering myself when deep into a run with several deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.

Yesterday I signed up for my first 5k on October 26. Today I wanted to see how far I could really run. 33 minutes got me 2.25 miles in the treadmill, but I learned that I go further when running outside, so I'm thinking 33 minutes nets me 2.5 miles.

Now I'm working on getting to 3.1 miles/5k! Next run is on Thursday and I'll be running outside again. Maybe I'll get to 5k then!

17,"Please, let it not be the shoes...","Hello! 

Since mid-W2 I have started to experience quite prominent knee and ankle, which is present during the day, not just when running. 

In the beginning I have blamed my body not being used to exercise and weak muscles for the pain, but now I find this to be an unlikely cause, since I'm not overweight, I walk a lot and quite fast, I usually take the stairs, and I remember picking up running (unsuccessfully) two years ago and not having the same issue.

Yesterday I finished W3 and I'm starting to actually feel the knees to swell after a run and I am honestly getting worried, that's why I decided to write to you for advice.

All of the similar questions from other redditors here basically resolve with buying the right shoes - and I have also thought of that, since I bought my pair on a whim, while they were on sale, looked really nice and were marked as ""trainers"" (meant for the gym) - They are Adidas Alphabounce EX. Of course this was an uneducated me who was not a part of this subreddit yet. *wink*

But, then I thought about years ago when I'm sure professional athletes were achieving great results with very basic gear, like basketball players in Converse... I mean, they are not so comfortable to walk in, let alone to have them on while running on the court for such a long time.

I'm not sure if this is an important piece of information, but I have supinated feet (high arches).

Normally a group of dog owners hang out at the field with their unleashed dogs where we run (right outside the fence to an empty, beautiful dog park, I don't know why they never go inside..). Each dog might run up and say hi, and it hasn't been a big deal until today. Some new punk dog showed up and not only was he super aggressive, he got the other dogs to chase us too! He wouldn't play and then go on his way, he wouldn't listen to a firm no, and worst of all he didn't listen while the owner tried to leash him for about 10 minutes. She had no control over him while he ran after kids playing soccer and other dogs, biting toward ankles and running around people in circles.

21,I came in dead last on a 5k and nothing bad happened.,"Hi all -


So my worst running fear came true this past weekend and I wanted to share for any of my fellow tortoises.


It is possible to be last in a race and not die of embarrassment. In fact, I even had fun.


This was technically my second 5k - my first one was three weeks ago and I finished in 49 minutes with no walking breaks. (I was not last, but everyone behind me walked the whole thing as it was a run/walk. Also, I was passed near the finish line by an 8 year old LOL.)¬†


However, this race was my goal race - the reason I started C25K three months ago. The race was to benefit the animal rescue we adopted our dog from, so I wanted to run it to support them and it was great motivation to get in shape. (My Good Boy helped me by coming along on some of my training runs, too!) I completed the entire C25K program and only missed one workout. (I had a six week perfect streak of 3 runs a week, running all the times I was supposed to run, and then I missed one because of the stomach flu - but then completed the rest.)¬† Even though I‚Äôm slow and bad, I know I did my absolute best and didn‚Äôt slack off at all.¬†


This goal race was an obstacle course run - and, I assumed that since running has always been something I‚Äôve been bad at, the running would be the hard part... and therefore focused my training mainly on running. This was dumb. Don't do this. I needed to do way more strength training, which became immediately apparent as I looked around at the muscles on all the other people who signed up. I was also sick, but just with a cold so I decided to go for it anyway.¬†


My legs were done after the 3rd obstacle. (There were a lot more than 3 obstacles LOL.) I walked, jogged a little, got to the part where I had to carry sandbags and run and jump over obstacles and tried and twisted my ankle, walked more, jogged a little more, failed to clear an obstacle and had to do burpees, got passed by everyone - and then had to pass the finish to start my second lap when most people were already finishing. A little ways into the second lap I was passed by the people who were clearing the signs, etc. (There was no road closure, it took place on a farm.) They told me that I was welcome to keep going and that they‚Äôd keep some beer cold for me at the end, haha!


I didn‚Äôt skip any obstacles (except one that was taken down by the time I got to it the second time) and I finished the whole distance, although I ran a lot less than I would have liked to.


I took me just under an hour and a half.¬†


They were still manning the finish line - there were two other ladies who only finished a minute or two ahead of me - and there were still bananas and beer. I got to pet lots of adoptable puppies. I was sore but fine. No one cared, or pointed, or laughed. I was terrified that this would happen - I'm a ridiculously slow runner - but I kept smiling and got nothing but positive encouragement from everyone along the course.


I‚Äôve already added strength training to my weekly workout plan, in addition to keeping up with running. Next year, I‚Äôll do it again - and faster!


TLDR: Go run a thing if you want to. Even if you come in last, no one cares, and it‚Äôs not as embarrassing as you think it will be. :) Someone always has to be last, after all!¬† Also, free advice, if you want to do an obstacle course run - you should train for an obstacle course run and not just do C25K.

Day 1 - I had to cut my final 5-minute run short by 2 minutes because I thought I might pass out. HR = 200 BPM, light-headed, rubbery legs, etc. It was the fist time I wasn't able to complete a day, so I was pretty discouraged.

Day 2 - Slowed my pace down and finished the running, but also lost a few tenths of a mile. Probably should have remembered my inhaler.

Day 3 - Somehow felt great. I finished the workout and decided to keep going to see where I was at for a full 5K. Finished in about 38.5 minutes. It's not going to get me any medals, but I did it!

My original goal was to be able to finish a 5K in 40 minutes, with a stretch goal of 35, by the end of the program. I guess I need to cut 5 minutes off of each of those?

77,Stomach pain at higher heart rates,"Hi all,

I'm actually using the 5k runner app, but I figured it was okay to post in here as they are similar ideas.

I just attempted week 7 day 3 which was a 5 minute warm up, 25 minute jog, and 5 minute cool down. About 15 minutes in I noticed that I was starting to get some nausea feeling/pain in my upper abdominal area, and that my heart rate was in the 180s. I hopped off for 30 seconds, my heart rate went down into the 160s, and the pain went away. I got back on for another 5 minutes and the pain came back when my HR went high again, stopped for a minute, it went away, and got back on. I ended up finishing the 25 minutes of jogging with maybe 2.5 of that being rest because of the nausea feeling.

The same thing happened 2 days ago when I did my second 20 minute jog (week 7 day 1 is 20 minutes, day 2 is 20 minutes, day 3 is 25) and I also noticed it happened when my heart rate was elevated, but I managed to jog through it.

Has anyone else experienced this before? Do you have any advice? This is my first time doing couch to 5k. I'm definitely overweight (5'11'', around 250lbs, 28 yo), and my goal in doing this program has been to become more heart healthy. I wanted to be able to do a 10k by January 1.

91,Turned 40 last week - and a lesson on good habits from my 8 yo son,"My (f40) kids take a shower every night. Most of the time they just do it, sometimes they fight me about it but rarely do we skip it. When they fight me, I remind them how much better they'll feel after a hot shower, fresh pjs and a cozy bed - this helps. 

Friday night, everyone was super low energy. We stayed up too late to watch a movie and had to drag ourselves off the couch. I told my 8 yo he could skip his shower if he wanted. I sent him upstairs to brush his teeth and get ready for bed. I started to tidy up and then I heard the shower turn on. When I went upstairs he was in bed waiting for me to read him a story.


me: hey kiddo - you took a shower?


son: oh! I forgot i didn't have to tonight! I guess i just did it without thinking. 


From there we had a great conversation about building good habits and how even though sometimes they feel annoying one day they will just be part of life and we will do them almost mindlessly.


Turned 40 last week. Despite trying to impress them on my kids I have never had the best wellness habits. So I started C25K again and I want to make it stick this time. I'm going to remember ""the shower"" as motivation to make it such a habit that it just becomes part of my day, without having to psych myself up everytime. I'm not making any goals (too much pressure), I'll probably skip days and repeat weeks but that's ok. I'm going to be gentle with myself and i'm going to do my best to look forward to my runs with my new wireless earbuds, my music and my podcasts.

66,Thank you r/c25k for helping me turn my life around,"TL;DR: This subreddit is awesome, the people are on it are awesome, and c25k turned me from an obese depressed guy to an overweight not depressed guy


In March of this year I was a wreck. I weighed 310lbs, was depressed, and was having a hard time getting through life. One night I was sitting in my car after a long day at work, not wanting to even make the walk to my apartment, and I remembered a thing called couch to 5k that a coworker had been telling me about. I hopped on reddit, look through some posts on here, and said ‚Äúscrew it, I can‚Äôt feel worse than I do now‚Äù. Threw on some sneakers and got my first W1D1 done. 

After three weeks on the program I had to stop. I was getting intense knee pain the days after my runs and since I work on my feet there was no way I could risk injury because it would put me out of work. That got me down for a little while, but after a week of daily visits to this subreddit I was motivated to start again. I figured that I was having the knee pain because I weighed so much, so it was time to lose some weight. I found some other awesome communities on reddit that helped me with my weight loss (shout out to r/loseit and r/intermittentfasting) and got to it. 

3 months later I weighed 250lbs. It took a month and half plateau for me to find c25k again, but when I finally got back into the swing of things it was on. Week 1 was easy peasy now that I was few pounds lighter. I remember when I first hit the 8 minute intervals I kept saying ‚Äúfuck you 8 minutes‚Äù over and over again until I was done. W5D3 kicked my ass. Then things started to click. I started getting ‚Äúrunners high‚Äù. I worked on my cadence, found a good pace for me, and got a proper pair of running shoes. Before I knew it I ran my first 5k. 

I kept on running after that and never stopped. Not really, rest days are super important. But I did start training for a 10k, and I freaking did it last Friday. This morning I ran my first sub 30 minute 5k. I was also officially 220lbs this morning, which is 90lbs down from my start weight and 25lbs away from my goal weight. While my fitness gains are awesome, the effect that running has had on me mentally is in a different league. I‚Äôm more confident, more driven, and happier in all aspects of my life. 

Throughout it all, this community has been there. From the very beginning to today. I don‚Äôt post or comment very often, but all of you wonderful people are a daily source of inspiration to me. So thank you to everyone here. Y‚Äôall are the real MVP‚Äôs. And if you‚Äôre at any point in the program, keep going.

I don't have room to pack my shoes, I don't know if I'll be near anywhere that's appropriate for running outside. But I will be doing a lot of walking during my trip.

At the start of the year I did the program from Week 0 and finished Week 7, and then stopped when it was cold and miserable and I'm a sook. This time I'm getting through each run pretty well, I'm running further and I'm less worn out than I was last time (which I'm pretty excited about).

I'm not sure what the best way to handle it will be if I can't really fit in any runs for two weeks. Do I start from W1? Start back at W3? Just restart W5?

I was making each segment after what felt like two weeks of trying. Then I made it to the second 5 minute run and when it was up, I just kept running. I ran for 9 minutes and probably could have run more.

It's like in Formula 1 when they say take corners slow to go fast, only it's take running slow to go longer.

22,Question about rest days,"Just wanted to get your opinion on how important rest days are when you're still fairly new into this program, mainly to see if you think skipping a rest day in between days and going two days in a row is fine.

To give you a background of my experience with C25K, I first used it about two years ago for a couple of weeks and then decided to skip following it and try to follow my SO instead - which is how I ended up being able to run 5k in just over half an hour (I honestly don't know how long I did C25K before that but I think it was only about 2-3 weeks).

To clarify I didn't go straight from skipping the program to running 5k, I simply ran as much as I could, walked when I was out of breath and then ran some more until a couple of weeks later I didn't have to walk anymore before finishing our route (which was around 5k, although only measured by Strava/GPS so it's quite possible it was a little less).

Anyway, life got busy and I stopped running for two years, gained way more weight than I'd care to admit but kept up with weightlifting on and off for the two years but never any real cardio.

Which brings me to now. I just started C25K again but there's no way I'm not finishing the program as intended (unlike last time) mainly because I know I'm a lot heavier before and don't want to risk any injury that could easily be avoided by taking days off and not pushing it too much (as well as that nice feeling of completing a run without feeling absolutely dead afterwards and sore the next day). Having said that I'll admit I do want to go ""faster"" to get to the really challenging weeks (which I think will be week five).

So finally to ask the actual question, do you think it's okay to just go through the W3 schedule by just doing it 3 days in a row? That would mean I'd finish the week on Thursday which would mean I could take Friday and Saturday as rest days (if I feel tired) and then start W4 on Sunday.  If I feel like it's fine I'd probably take a day to rest and then see how W4D1 feels before deciding if I need a rest day before every run, that is if I'm still unable to bike on rest days. 

While getting through W1 &amp; W2 I biked every rest day (not long rides, between 30-60 minutes each time at about 25km/h pace). Unfortunately I wont be able to do that for this week (maybe next week) so I'm hoping to speed up the process of C25K just a bit. 

Sorry for the wall of text, hope this was enough for you to judge whether or not I should be good to go or if I should just take it slow and keep going every other day (even if it means I won't bike in between or do any strength training).

Thanks for the advice and getting through this text. Oh and thanks to this community for all the motivating posts I keep seeing, it definitely helps me keep at it!",C25K,1568174473,two42toyoutoo,7,3,True,2019-09-10

62,FINALLY BROKE THROUGH WEEK 5,"I've been struggling to break through the 20 minute run in week 5 for the last two months -- I continuously started walking mid-way through the run, and felt like I was just being mentally weak which was so frustrating.

Last week I went running with my S/O for the first time. He's Extremely Fit and I've avoided running with him because he can be a hard ass and that communication style makes me defensive when I feel frustrated or self-conscious. He actually wound up giving me the tools to accomplish my run, and I doubt I would have ever done it without him. Here's what changed -- maybe it can help you:

\- I always run with headphones, and I always blast music to help motivate myself. That's cool, but it also meant I couldn't hear my breathing and I don't know my body well enough to understand how I'm breathing. While running with my S/O he was like ""uh...you start hyperventilating right before you stop running."" I had no fucking idea -- he said it sounds like my breathing does when I have a panic attack. I gag a lot during a run (I have acid reflux) and shortly after I'd lose control of my breathing. He noticed this pattern but I've been doing this for two months and never put it together.

\- He taught me to breathe into my stomach, like you sometimes do in yoga. Usually before I started hyperventilating, my breath would get shallower and shallower until I was just chest breathing and then just totally out of breath. I ran with one earbud out today and focused on stomach breathing, and it was like keeping a foot on the gas pedal. I could have kept running. It felt amazing.

\- He taught me to slow down even more. I'm not a fast runner. I average about 10-11 min/mile. In moments where I wanted to start walking, he taught me to essentially run in place. Today I felt winded pretty early on -- within a mile --  and I just slowed way the fuck down to almost a slow walking pace (but continuing to jog). As my body adjusted and I continued to focus on my breathing, my pace naturally picked up when my body was ready for it.

I cannot overstate how much this program has done for me. I just want to share my story to this amazing supportive sub.

Six weeks ago I was an obese, depressed middle aged woman, feeling like I was wasting my life and wasting away on the couch. I tried to pick up a bunch of different sports but nothing seemed to stick - until I tried something I never ever thought I would do: I went out into the woods and ran.

With Laura's encouraging words in my ears I jogged/shuffled/huffed and puffed my way through the weeks. Some days were hard, some were easy and slowly but surely I learned to run, and to love it. Today I completed W7 D1 and it was one of the harder days. But I still loved it. The weather was warm but pleasant, the woods were beautiful and the whole thing lifted my spirits today like no amount of chocolate and netflix ever could.

Now I am still a fat depressed middle aged woman, but Laura said that I am also a runner. And that might make all the difference.

Fast Forward to 2 weeks ago when I decided to finally forget the excuses and start up again in order to jumpstart a healthier life style.

I was barely able to finish Week 2 Day 3 as my shins were in some serious pain. Even walking back to the house was tough. I stretched them out after and the serious pain went away and I was just left with the general soreness I've been used to over the last two weeks. 

At first I thought the soreness was just normal since these muscles haven't been put through this stress in a long while, so I just pushed through it. Now I'm wondering it may be something more serious and perhaps I'm pushing too hard. I'm hoping this is not the case as I'm starting to get into the routine again and I really do not want to fail this time.

So, I‚Äôm not done with c25k yet, but tomorrow is W7D3 and I‚Äôm close. W7D2 I actually continued to run, and I wanted to see if I could run a 5k... I did!! 

But.. surprisingly I feel like c25k taught me way more than ‚Äúhow to run far, how to pace yourself, etc‚Äù. It taught me a few things:

‚Ä¢The things I am afraid to do, and think I cannot do, are very much mental. That first 20 minute run I thought ‚Äúno fucking way‚Äù. But I did it, and I almost cried.

‚Ä¢I learned to not care what people think. My first few weeks I ran at like 5 different parks. Why? I was trying to find the most secluded one. I didn‚Äôt want people seeing me struggle, and huff and puff. Now I don‚Äôt care. I found a lake I like to run around, which is actually kind of a tourist spot here. I don‚Äôt care what people think, this is my journey not theirs.

‚Ä¢Progress isn‚Äôt instant. A lot of things have taught me this, but progress is slow. But looking back, it does feel like its overnight. I feel like yesterday I could hardly run for a minute straight.

But, yea!! That‚Äôs my ramble for today. I‚Äôm so glad I decided to do this program. It helped me get back on track with my diet (70 pounds down!!!). AND I decided to join CrossFit!

54,"""Failure"" or ""Failing a run"" is not the correct way to view runs in C25K. It can lead to self doubt and quitting, which is the opposite intent of the program.","[Disclaimer] This is an awesome community! If you feel discouraged and need to vent about it, this is the best place to do so, because we get it! I don't mean to prevent anyone from coming here to look for support.

But I do think a lot of beginners have the wrong idea about completing the C25K program.

If you make it through a run, congrats! its time to move on to the next day. 

But if you can't finish a run, please do not think of it as a failure. (...it means you're running too fast, but that's for another post.) 
It means that you have discovered your current running level - your current goal. You might meet that goal the very next run, or it might take three runs, or five. But eventually you will run the full time, and most likely fine it easier to complete your next few days as well. But it is only a placeholder for where you are physically, and it will *never* stay there as long as you keep running.

That is how C25K works. A lot of people can cruise right through the program with a bit of a struggle but not have to repeat any days... A lot of people can't. The beauty of C25K is that it really does work for everyone.


**Unless** You get it in your head that not completing any given day is a failure. Even if you don't intend to stop running, it can still have an effect. No one likes to fail, and sometimes we put off doing a thing if we think we might fail. A small excuse can be well intended, but every person who has ever quit, ended with an excuse.

The very first time I tried C25K, I ran 30 seconds and stopped. I thought I was going to throw up. I deleted the app because if I couldn't even make it through the first section of the very first day, why bother?
I wasted 2 years of my life with that failure reminding me why I shouldn't try again.

Been doing a 5K loop at walking pace (think the warm up walk) for a couple of weeks before C25K.

I do the W1D1 for example on that loop and then extend the final warm-down walk to the rest of the loop.

This has been the same right up to W4D2 completed yesterday. But I added extra rest days in as legs/knees sore.

Also, my gym has a weekly yoga class, which sounds fun.

So I'm just wondering what other kinds of exercise you guys are doing, and how you fit it into your schedule. I've been told different things about how it's bad to do both heavy cardio and weights in the same session, and that there should be at least a day between the two, so I'm really not sure how to proceed.",C25K,1567542645,egyptianspacedog,4,4,True,2019-09-03

Today, though, I had an appointment with my doctor and the readings for my blood pressure were off the charts high. After discussing this with my MD, who had seen it be lower in the past when I was exercising and doing marching band and playing baseball, we agreed that I had two ways to approach the situation: either a) get back into shape and back down to my weight range from when I was playing baseball or be monitored for a few more weeks and be put on blood pressure meds when those results came back.

I've chosen the first. I'm going to get my shit together and get it done this time, and then keep at it. This is a problem of my creation, and I'm gonna solve it myself, too.

90,"first 5k, what next?"," So,  yesterday I (34 M) ran my first 5K, actually it was almost 6K. I started running in July, doing C25K. I never liked running, never ran, and  I am very happy about progress so far.

Now, problem is I am very slow (5K in 42 min) and if I try to run faster I find it vary hard to maintain my pace and I get tired vary fast.

So far I don't have plans to run greater distances, I would like to be able to run 5K in 30 or so minutes but I am not quite sure how to get there.

In my mind I have 2 options: 1) steadily increase my distance or try to run smaller distances (2-3 km) with increased pace. Also,  I am overweight (104 kg, 1.84 m) so I am hoping my speed will increase a bit by losing weight.

94,Tricks that make you forget you're running.,"So I'm stuck on W4D1 and part of my problem is getting over the mental aspect that I have to run for 5 minutes. I'm perfectly fine for running for 3 minutes but then when it comes to 5 minutes, my mind thinks ""oh, this is going to take *forever*"" and then I quit after 2 minutes.

I tried listening to music, but then my mind starts thinking ""this song is 3-5 minutes long. I can't make it that long.""

So now instead of listening to music that I know, I'm listening to a techno station. I'm not proficient in techno music, so as far as my mind knows, the music continues on forever as techno stations tend to blend one song to the next.

This trick didn't work when I tried W4D1 yesterday, but to be honest, I hadn't run in a week. I'm going to attempt again today, but I'm curious to know how others get over mental blocks.",C25K,1567604706,pacifien,19,10,True,2019-09-04

In my last post, I mentioned being able to run 4 minutes on, 2 minutes walking, four times, so I thought W3 would be a cakewalk afterwards. I was so wrong. I just could not mentally get past the second 3 minute run. :(

Every time I tried, something seemed off. It seems I have to have every element in place to get a successful run: I need a rest day, I need to drink TONS of water ahead of time, I need to stretch every leg muscle, I need good music, and, most important of all, I need to tell myself I can do it!

Yesterday, I tried again for the fifth time and was practically in tears while running the second 3 minute run, but I told myself I wasn't going to fail a fifth time and finished it! Today, I'm going to work on my core and then tomorrow I will try W3D2.

So if there's a day you can't seem to do, just keep doing it! Eventually you'll get there!

8,Speed was my enemy,"So just wanted to share my method in case it might help anyone else. I had never ran more than maybe a mile until a couple months ago. I had tried, unsuccessfully, the C25K program probably 5 or 6 times in the past but could never make it farther than maybe 4 or 5 weeks in. This time for some reason it felt different. I decided to run the absolute slowest I had to to finish it. I legit was getting lapped by little old lady walkers, didn't care this time. I actually made it to the end of the program, still not quite at the 5k distance even though I had the time so I slowly started adding distance. Each run I tracked on my apple watch and I would add .05 mile to each day, just a little each time. Then after doing this for a couple weeks I bumped to adding .1 mile each time. I'm finally up to the 5k mark, I'm still slow (14.5-15min miles) but I'm doing it. I've ran the distance of a 5k 3 times in the last week. Going to continue adding .1 to my workouts and see where I eventually end up.

13,FINISHED! Celebratory post from a lurker :),"Finally made it to 30 min! I previously got to week 5 some years ago but then quit. Restarted the program at the end of February this year and finished last night. Few things I learned that helped me:

\- Go slow! I took my time with the longer 20+ min runs, if I felt like I didn't nail it I kept trying or cycled back to the 10 min intervals, stopped focusing on the weeks/days and moved ahead when I was comfortable.

\- Playlist! At first I had a giant one and ended up skipping songs constantly. Had the bright idea to pick my favorites and create one that would be timed to have that perfect last track hitting at the end of the run. GAME-CHANGER! Now I don't even check my time, I know by the order of the songs approximately where I'm at and it keeps me motivated thinking about it in 3-4 min chunks.

\- Rest days! I tried to do 2 on 1 off, near week 5 I pushed myself a little too much doing 3 days straight and got the dreaded shin splints, took about 2 weeks off to recover. As good as it felt to keep it going day after day, had to remind myself I am not a professional athlete and my body needs time to adjust to this new physical activity.

\- Stretching! Kind of goes with the last point, after the shin issues I started making the effort to do a few stretches before and after each run, definitely helped cut down on some of the muscle aches and pains felt during and after.

Overall I am SUPER pleased with the way the program worked for me, excited to continue training, hoping to work my way up to a full 5k in the next few months (30 min clocked in at about 2.3mi) and sign up for a race before the end of the year.

- Slow pace is fine.  I listed to the Beastie Boys C25K podcast that I found [here](http://www.c25kplaylists.com/4801.html), because the tempo of the music is a bit slower, and it kept me from trying to run to the tempo of something a bit more frantic.

I started C25K and have just today finished the dreaded W5D3.  I had a question regarding treadmill speeds.  I have done a majority of my workouts outside at a park or on a sloped track(don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the term but the rounded edges are small hills.). For week 5 however, I have had to do a treadmill as my track was closed and the humidity and heat has been unbearable.  Nearly 110 degrees at 80-100% humidity, and it rained today.  

So my question is, doing my workouts on the treadmill has felt much easier than outdoors.  So to help challenge myself and acclimate myself more towards the outdoors, I ran on a 1 incline.  I did 10 minutes at 5.5 speed, 7 minutes on 6.0 speed, and 3 minutes on 7.0 speed all on the one inclines. My reasoning was when running outdoors, your speed will variably change and I didn‚Äôt want to acclimate to a single  exact speed throughout the entire workout.  So do you guys see any issues with this whether that be short term or long term?  Made sense in my head but want other perspectives on the matter

57,First official 5k tomorrow!

My goal tomorrow is to maintain at least this pace, but shaving my time down to 26-28 min overall would be awesome. I plan to have a light breakfast and do lots of stretching, and maybe a short walk before the run.

 I have 2 pairs of shoes I run in. One pair is just loose slip-on shoes that are flat while the other pair are actual running shoes and the back is raised a bit. If I run in the loose shoes my calfs hurt but my shins don't bother me. If I run in the running shoes my shins hurt but my calfs don't bother me. All the pain ceases after working out and I don't have any pain the next day, so I figure it's just me building muscle but I am not sure which one is better.

I didn't want to stop and fiddle with everything and then start the warm up again (I walk on a specific beach trail loop and adding in another 5 minute walk would have messed it up) so I just kept going.   I assumed I accidently pressed W6D1, but when I got done and pressed stop it said W6D2.

62,PSA: Wash off immediately after your run!,"Alright, so this is borderline TIFU and just flat out embarrassing, but since a lot of runners here are new, including myself, this intel be passed on. TL;DR at the bottom.

I bumped uglies with an old fling last month. This was, coincidentally,  when I started hitting an average run distance of 3.5 miles a run without stopping. I also live in Floridas, so after my runs I was *drenched*. I *love* the feeling of sweat. That first bead that dribbles off my forehead fuels my running fire. Something primal in me awakens after that first drip. 

Now, my post-run habits aren't the best. I would lounge around to cool off for a bit. There were a couple of instances where I sat behind my PC and got wrapped up talking to friends in discord soaked in my own running juice. *I know, I know*. This is pretty fucking gross in hindsight. 

Fast forward to two weeks after my love session, I noticed a little bump above Mr. Johnson... *surprisedpikachu.jpg*. It was just below my waistline, but still in the ""patch"" if you know what I mean. I popped it and a decent amount of blood and some other fluid came out of it, but no pus. A couple of days later I came down with a weird flu. My throat *glands* were sore, but my throat wasn't, my muscles felt achy, and my back was locked up to the point the most basic movements were painful. It felt as if I haf a rod fused to my spine in the mornings. This is also when I noticed I also developed a bump on *the exit*. I'm surprised I didn't fall over in my bathroom contorting myself into yoga positions trying to take pictures of this thing to get a better look at it. 

I started researching and everything pointed towards herpes. For the next couple of days, I was going back and forth between ""Dude, it could been anything."" and ""It's definitely herpes."" from the slightest tingle. I was so convinced that I was infected that I almost had a nervous breakdown at work.

I went to get inspected and my doctor put my mind at ease and said it was a definitely a fungal infection, with a small hemorrhoid down under. He could tell I was freaked out and was adament that there was nothing to worry about. He prescribed me a Z-pack for the flu and a cream for the bump. I powered through the next couple of days and the flu subsided, but thats when...

I had a friend come from out of town the day I got back from the doctor. Right after I finished the Z-pack, I developed an itch so bad that I was scratching the boys every couple of minutes, and it was *everywhere* down there. My thighs, the buddies, Mr. Johnson, and I was still in trench warfare with the hemorrhoid so I defitely wasn't sitting pretty. In fact, I wasn't sitting very much at all. My mind jumped straight back to ""NOPE THIS IS DEFINITELY THE HERP. NO SEX FOREVER NICE JOB, NEXTLEVELMOVES""

I went to the doctor again ~two weeks after my first visit. She checked out the bump and *immediately* said ""Yeah, that's definitely fungal. Did you use the cream you were prescribed?"" *Oh yeah, the fucking cream!* When my friend came down, it completely slipped my mind that I had it. She lifted up my little guy and showed me *where it was spreading up the shaft*.

She gave a little more detail than the first doctor. It's uncommon but entirely possible to get flu symptoms from an unchecked fungal infection, and occosionally they'll swell up into a little bump. Apparently anti-biotics sent the little candida growth I had going on down there from sweating so much into overdrive and it spread to the love shack, even though there wasn't a rash from the bump to the turkey neck. In fact, since there are so many folds down there and stays warm, that's one of it's favorite places to grow. 

Thankfully the anti-fungal pill and the cream seem to be doing the trick, but I'll never forget the headspace I was in when I was convinced my unit was infected. It's handsdown in the top 5 of the most aweful feelings I've ever had.

TL:DR - Didn't dry off the nuggets after running. Thought I got herpes *twice*. Unscented spray on deoderant for sensitive skin before a workout can also help with keeping the nether region from turning into a swamp during a workout, too",C25K,1566615260,NextLevelMoves,5,8,True,2019-08-23

One thing I leaned today is that the final 7k are much more mental than physical.

I wasn't super regular since I finished C25K, had some long spells with no running (3-4 weeks, more than once) but the cool thing about running is that there's no one to judge you, we can just get back to running as many times as we've quit and we're cool.

18,Returning to the fray.,"I originally did C25K November 2017 through until mid February 2018. I kept jogging until the end of February, and then stopped. Not once since.

So I've decided to begin again from scratch, and make sure I keep it up this time. I could try to figure out which week I'm capable of, or I could spend a few extra weeks and just start again from scratch. I've decided to go with the latter option. A few extra weeks doesn't mean anything, and I end up in the same spot.

And I'm starting off in the worst possible way by doing the very thing I always lay in to people to not ever do. I'm doing 3 days in a row. But Thursday I'm driving 8+ hours to a country town to attend a funeral, I want this first week out of the way before heading there. It's such an easy week. If it were any other week I'd just skip days or try to find time down there to do it.

Last week I did 5 minutes straight of running and felt I could keep going. The only reason I didn't is because I had already decided I was heading home once that lap was finished.

I did my 3rd 5k run two weeks ago and then admittedly took a break from running, knowing full well that a ""break"" can easily turn into the end of exercising.

Something that suprised me is that Im out of breath just as quickly as I was when I started the C25k plan. I didn't expect any huge changes within just a few weeks but I basically just endure being out of breath a bit longer now than when I started.

I'm just as out of breath after 400m now as I was a couple of weeks ago, only that I simply keep going now until I reach the 5-6k.

  
I'm not running too fast either even though ironically the common advice to find the right speed is to run just slow enough that you could have a normal conversation with someone for the majority of the distance. I'd be walking the 5 kilometres if I were to follow that advice, even though Im neither a smoker nor overweight.

87,W3D1 take three: failure followed by success,"I'm doing the C25K program but I'm also seeing a personal trainer. I managed to successfully do a week 3 program last Thursday but have failed every attempt at repeating that since then. I tried again yesterday and didn't make it past the second 3 minute run. I know my failure is entirely mental, so when I told my personal trainer that yesterday, he said we were going to run for 4 minutes 4 times. I half felt like crying and half felt determined to show him that I could do it.

So I got on the treadmill and we covered the timer on it. I'd only slow down when my personal trainer gave me a 5 second countdown.

The first 4 minutes, I instinctively went to turn it down at the 3 minute mark without even realizing it was 3 minutes, but my personal trainer swatted my hand away. I managed the 4 minutes but felt so out of breath, I didn't know if I could handle another 4 minutes. I walked for 2 minutes and started again.

The second 4 minutes came up, and then a particular song came on my headphones that I've run to before. I was once able to run the length of the song which is 5 minutes and 17 seconds. So I told myself I could do it, and then the 4 minutes were up and I could slow down again.

The third 4 minutes came up, and I just replayed the song, telling myself I could make it to the end of the song. Then my 4 minutes was up again.

At the fourth 4 minute run, I was convinced I was going to have to stop at 2 minutes, but then something happened: I simply stopped thinking about the time and ran. It was the easiest of the four 4 minute runs.

I'm going to try W3D1 again for the fourth time and this time I *know* I can do it. I realized my mental block was viewing running like drowning: so out of breath I was convinced I'd never get air into my lungs again and so I'd beg to stop and walk. But running isn't like drowning: I'm out of breath but I can still breathe. I can still get oxygen into my lungs so there's no reason to stop running.",C25K,1565790277,pacifien,8,14,True,2019-08-14

This year, I'm training for the SpeakUp5k virtual run to benefit a mental health nonprofit, and I've been able to be consistent because the race actually *means* something to me. Money raised from the race helps fund the CKG Foundation, which raises awareness for teenage anxiety &amp; depression and provides free mental health programming for teens -- I actually started volunteering with CKG too, and both the work I'm doing with them and the knowledge that my running helps them have kept me super motivated and intentional about my training.

Growing up dealing with anxiety, PTSD, &amp; anorexia, it's something that means a lot to me, and I've had hardly any issues getting in my training because it's so meaningful to me. I'm actually ahead of schedule right now and running for 20 min straight!

I really encourage you to find a race that's meaningful and motivating for you - to find a purpose behind your running. That's what's helped me stay committed to my training.




Also if you're interested in the SpeakUp5k virtual run, it's September 7 and you can participate from anywhere in the world! The link is [here](https://runsignup.com/Race/VA/Richmond/SpeakUp5kRichmond)

Since I volunteer with CKG, they've given me a discount code to share - if you use code ALLIE at checkout, you'll get $5 off registration.

I don't get any kickback if you use the code and neither does anyone else - it's just an amazing cause and I'd love for more people to help in raising awareness for mental health üòä",C25K,1565819839,liquid_nitrogenn,0,5,True,2019-08-14

Then I opened the app a few times, made plans to run here and there. But I always found excuses not to try again. Then a few months ago a bunch of my friends decided they wanted to run a 10k by Thanksgiving. I opened the app again. I ran w1d1 mostly around my apartment complex. On one of the later runs (I think 6), I ended right outside my apartment, so I took it as a sign and went inside.  

Last night, I decided I wanted to take this seriously. No excuses. So I set a plan. It wasn't perfect. I wasn't as hydrated as I would've liked. I forgot my Fitbit (I knew if I went back for it after I was out, I'd probably not make it back out the door again). It looked like rain.

I used to run regularly - 5km 3 or 4 times a week about 3 years ago. When we had kids that stopped and I've done bigger all of nothing exercise wise since. I am 35yo, 180cm and fluctuate between about 80 and 100kg. I'm currently 99.5kg.

I was all ready and prepared to get back into my C25K program this morning. Strava installed, Spotify playlist sorted, clothes ready to go. 

However, my 3yo was very sick overnight. Temperature was &gt;39¬∞C and he ended up in our bed. He's a restless sleeper and kept tossing, turning and kicking me. I ultimately got up at 3am and went to the spare bed.

My alarm went off at 5am... and I ignored it. Rubbish sleep so decided to delay it and start tomorrow. Yes, I acknowledge it's just 'making excuses'. No, I'm not throwing in the towel before I've started. Yes, I will pound the pavement tomorrow!

59,"Hitting The Wall...or, maybe An Adventure In Training Smart","Briefly, I've fumbled through the C25K app a few times in the past, gotten about 6 weeks deep, and have run a few fun 5k events.  But, it's always sucked.  Running is something I've never enjoyed at all, which is a little hard because my wife is a pretty avid runner (currently in training for a marathon!).  So, this summer, I wanted to spend a little more time with her (and our new dog), so I decided to look into running a little more seriously:  Athletic shorts, running shoes, the whole bit.

I've done a few local clinics on good-form running, and I'm really trying to get into it.  But, life gets in the way, and I haven't been able to commit to 3 runs a week for pretty much the entire month of July.  As a result, I've been struggling immensely with the 5 minute running intervals seen in Week 4 and Week 5...we're talking not just short of breath, but wheezing and tunnel vision.  I did a hard reset to Week 3 today, and wound up struggling pretty hard with the 3 minute runs even.  Funny thing, too:  According to my logs from 2014 and 2015, I struggled right around the same point back then, but just kept on pushing myself through the misery.

81,Repeating weeks to build speed?,"Hi fellow c25kers! I attempted the program last year but stopped around week 6, and am now starting it again. So far, weeks 1 and 2 have been a breeze!

However, I have to run pretty slow to not tire myself out, basically a light jog. For week 2, my paces have been 13 to 14 mins/mile. According to Strava, I had a 1/2 mile segment that I ran in 6 mins, so that's promising. I don't have premium Strava, so I can't look at charts to see what my exact pace is during running.

I'm a really skinny and short lady (4'11""). Are such paces for these weeks just normal for my height or something? Other joggers at the park pass me by, even when I feel like I'm running a bit faster than usual. It just seems slow, and I'd really like to build up speed. 

So what is the best way to do this? Should I even focus on speed at all now? Is it better to set it aside until I am at the end of the plan, and then start building speed? Or should I try repeating weeks to get to a faster pace before moving on?",C25K,1565063047,coolestly,6,5,True,2019-08-05

I have tried every possible thing I‚Äôve seen online- it isn‚Äôt my clothing or lotion, or the weather. Doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with if I shaved or not. Isn‚Äôt a food allergy. I tried a store brand antihistamine and saw no difference whatsoever. I‚Äôm not short of breath (other than like... the obvious increased respiratory rate when exercising). And it stops when I stop running. But I want to run...

Has anyone experienced this? I seriously feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I have the endurance to run so much longer, but the itching is literally mind numbing. I cannot take it. 

If you had this, did it go away after continuing to run? How long did it take? Do I need a stronger antihistamine? Sorry for the desperation.. just so discouraged, feeling kind of trapped by this.",C25K,1563923533,michellekimb,1,2,True,2019-07-23

47,W1D1 - a struggle!,"I'm 32F, around 3st overweight, and havent had a proper exercise regimen for around 5 years, so I'm not in great shape. Looking to change that, hence starting c25k.

My husband runs a lot, does the 5k parkrun every Saturday and various 10k races in the local area throughout the year, so I thought I'd try to get up to speed and join him in the 5k runs by the end of this year.

Went out for W1D1 yesterday after work, and wow... I only managed 3 of the run sections (ran the 1st, 2nd, walked the 3rd, ran the 4th), and honestly my legs just couldn't keep me up after that.

I suffer with plantar fasciitis due to very tight calves (I stretch every day, but my calves are still sore 90% of the time)... my heel wasnt so bad during the run, but my calves were so sore I had to stop. I also found my shins hurting a bit towards the end.

I'm not sore today (no more than usual with my calves anyway), so I'm not going to give up. I'm going out again tomorrow night when it's a bit cooler and hoping I can improve a little.

I know I've made the biggest step by actually getting out of the house and trying... I'm just feeling pretty deflated right now I guess? I'm after some assurance that it gets better/easier?",C25K,1563971637,ItsJustABigCow,7,13,True,2019-07-24

First attempt was on the treadmill, second was outside on the footpath and tonight was also an outdoor run. Tonight was actually the most I struggled. I‚Äôve grown up with severe asthma, I‚Äôve always hated running and tonight I just could not breathe. I‚Äôm beating myself up because a few years ago I was really fit - I was heavily involved in a sport that was a lot of sprinting and though it was a slow pace I was able to run 30 mins non-stop. So I guess I‚Äôm feeling really upset at myself for letting my fitness slip away and putting on weight. 

The outdoor runs are so much harder for me but I don‚Äôt want to use asthma and allergies as an excuse because I know I‚Äôve been able to do it before. But damn I was wheezing like someone who has been smoking for 40 years! I couldn‚Äôt take a deep breath. Are we meant to be breathing deep when we run? I know when I sprint it‚Äôs super short quick breaths...

I feel like I will never overcome this particular run. W5D2 was fine and now I‚Äôve tried Day 3 three times and ugh. And I‚Äôm also running so extremely slow, I can definitely walk faster. I‚Äôm at like 10 minutes/km and I can‚Äôt even keep that up. Feeling so down about this. Would love any tips you might have about running with asthma (particularly outdoors), successful tales of being a turtle‚Äôs grandfather and how you made it through this hurdle of a run in the program.

I do additionally walk with my baby every morning for aprx 1hr pushing her stroller.

I had been running outside with my 40lb toddler in her stroller but was finding it really hard to keep up this time. (Other parents running while pushing a stroller - do not diminish how much harder it becomes!) I changed to running inside on the treadmill during her naps. Ran into some shin pain last week so got new runners, which feel amazing. Tried again on week 6 day 1 and failed. Spent the last week just walking outdooors with my baby and doing aerobics videos. Tried week 5 day 1 again today and it felt like my legs were encased in concrete and a bit of achilles pain/tension so I stopped. Lungs felt great. I made it through 1.5 of the runs. I'm not sure where to go from here.

I do have 2 autoimmune diseases and they might be causing issues. I don't want to make excuses for myself. I always say to everyone else ""progress not perfection"" but today it did feel better to go back.

I was getting hot and took a walking break for about a minute or so, but ran the rest of the way back. Really had to push it at the end. But I DID IT! I made it 5k!!

This run:

Distance- 3.11 mi

Pace- 11:36/mi (did not know I had that in me, I'm super happy)

Total time- 36:05

Year to Date:

Total Distance: 28.7mi

Average pace: 14:11/mi

Goals for the Future:

-Finish c25k (2 more weeks!)

-Hal Higdon's novice base training (will start after c25k)

87,How slow is too slow?,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

Quick background about myself: 30, male, at age 25 I was 350lbs and on my way to being a Type 2 diabetic. Always have struggled w/ weight my entire life and always was ""the fat kid"" growing up. Decided to make a change 5 yrs ago, I dropped down to 235 over the course of 3 years, with heavy lifting and IFFYM. Now I've climbed back up, gaining 50lbs back in the last 2 years. While I've gotten stronger and my lifts have gone up, I'm moving in the opposite direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Started Couch to 5k a couple weeks ago and cleaned up my diet big time, lost 7lbs already and can feel the gain train coming back into the station :) - my question is this:

&amp;#x200B;

How slow is too slow? Being a heavy runner, I can't run super fast for long peroids. I just finished Week 2 (#6 workout) and I'm moving into Week 3. I notice my next run has me go for 4 mins straight, double what I've been used to running so far. The couple 3 minute segments I had last run weren't awful but defenitly slowed down about .5mph. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering, is 5mph on the treadmill considered too slow? It is a jog for me, at a steady pace. I try to do 5.5 or 6+ mph when I have shorter running segments, but is it okay to slow down to a slow jog pace as the time gets longer?

&amp;#x200B;

Before anyone says I should run outside - I run on the treadmill because it's easier on my joints and I'm already at the gym to lift, and I do other outdoor activities.

95,Finished C25k for the 3rd time,"I first completed C25k in 2014 and the ran fairly consistently for about 2 years before letting life get in the way and taking a year off. Completed it the second time in 2017, but again let things get in the way and stopped shortly after. I attempted to complete it twice last year, but was never successful because I went through a ton of huge life changes last year and running just wasn‚Äôt my top priority. 

This morning I finished the program for the third time in 5 years. I‚Äôll be honest. It‚Äôs been frustrating for me redo the program so many times because it feels like starting over from nothing. But really that‚Äôs not true. Over the years it‚Äôs gotten easier to finish C25k because I know I can do it. And running is largely a mental battle. If you think you can or you know you can, you will. 

I‚Äôve also gotten faster every time. My average pace right now is basically the same as my average pace after working hard and running consistently for at least 6 months the first time I got into running. 

So for those of you who are like me, who have been here before and are feeling down about having to start over again, things will be even better this time than they were last time. And you know what? If your options are starting over from the beginning or giving up and never running again I think it‚Äôs clear what the better option is.

21,"Pain in the lower stomach, right side","After never continuing with running after I graduated C25K last year I re-started a few weeks ago. I‚Äôm doing the distance based version and today I finished week 7 (3x 4km).

W7D1 was kinda easy. I did the 4km in 28 minutes.
W7D2 everything was fine for the first 3km but during the last km I felt some pain in the area described before. It got so bad I had to stop and go for maybe 200 meters, after that I continued a little slower. I finished in 28:45 minutes.
W7D3 aka today was the worst. First km was fine but during the second the pain started again. I immediately slowed down a bit and finished the 2nd and 3rd km, after that I had to add walking again. The pain would always go away during walking but come back as soon as I started running/jogging. I finished with a total time of 30:53.

All runs were evening runs, D1 was 2 hours after dinner, D2 before dinner and D3 after having a small snack (still before dinner) since I thought that may be the reason. I had at least one rest day in between. And I never felt this kind of pain my entire life before (or during runs in my teenage years which were much longer). My bf suggested this may come from the appendix but as far as I‚Äòm informed the pain wouldn‚Äòt just go away and come back 2 days later and then go away again. Other than that I‚Äòm also totally fine, eating normal and there are no signs of any illness. 

I mean, I know that the progress for a beginner will be slow and that there might be not much change in my pace at all for a few months, but after W7D1 was so easy and the other to runs were not I‚Äòm just really demotivated rn. 

Any tipps? Any idea where this might come from? Should I re-do week 7 or give week 8 (3x 4.5km) a try? Or add a ‚Äúrest week‚Äù? Should I check if it goes away by itself or see a doctor? Thanks for any advice!",C25K,1561316425,AcademicAlpaca,7,1,True,2019-06-23

I'm assuming speed wise the 4 levels would looks something like this:

Jog

Steady

Tempo

Fast

Where I'm struggling with it is trying to put that down to a speed that I should be running. I wear a garmin when I run, so it's pretty easy for me to see when I'm going a bit faster.

For reference, when I ran my 5K after graduating I ran it at approx 7.30 min/KM. So that's what I'm taking as my Steady speed.

46,Feel stuck &amp; keep regressing &amp; don't know if there's any point in continuing really (a rant to myself),"
This is basically just gonna be me venting &amp; getting some shit off my chest. 

Nothing useful whatsoever so feel free to ignore.

I've on &amp; off (with a a fair bit more stress on ""off"") been doing the C25K program since Feb this year (did Pre C25K in Jan) but the thing is no matter I can't seem to get past Week 3. 

I know it's mainly due to inconsistency. I don't think I've managed to do 3 runs in a week since May. I try. I really do. But I've just had (&amp; keep having) so many obstacles get in my way - I've been far more sick this year than I have in the last 5 put together (I don't really know what's happening there tbh prob just my immune system deciding to give up turning to complete &amp; utter shite). It's seriously so inconvenient &amp; annoying af. I don't really know what to do about this one. I become like bed bound every two to three weeks. 

Ofc I've been struggling with my mental health too - agoraphobia, cPTSD, depression &amp; anxiety are real bastards that get in the way of any &amp; all progress or just you know life in general. It's like if I take one step forward I end up taking 5 steps back. It's hard you know to care about or feel motivated enough to go for a run when you can barely make it outta bed to brush your teeth &amp; all you can really think about all day long is dying. I'm trying with this one. I am. It's really the only reason I actually run to somewhat help manage some stuff I'm not good at putting into words. But ofc self-sabotage is just like breathing now &amp; old habits die hard. 

Periods were a big one too - mine absolutely fucking suck &amp; somehow leave me even less functional then I already am. Luckily (&amp; amazingly) this one seems to be something I've finally managed to work out. My doc at last agreed to let me go on BC (I suffer from pretty intense migraines &amp; most birth control isn't safe to use apparently). It only been 2 and a half weeks (&amp; it can take 3 months to see if it's working properly) so I still have a bit of ways to go but so far so good. I can't explain how explain how incredible it feels to not have to dread getting my period. It's so damn freeing. 

I always heard 'practice makes latter's which I took to translating as practice makes better since we all there's no such thing as perfect. &amp; I don't know if my being is subconsciously being contrary but I seem to be getting worse at running (that's if I can even call it that any longer). I'm getting slower &amp; slower &amp; it's getting harder &amp; harder (mind I also haven't progressed soooo...)  Earlier in the year what I could do without thinking twice about has now become an epic fucking struggle. It's really ducking disheartening. Not only is my mind unreliable but I guess my body has decided to  betray me too. Even doing Week 1 is a legit struggle now. If I believed in shit like signs this would probably be one screaming at me to give up already. 

And then there's just the whole shitty life situation that there's no way out of. I've unexpectedly had to become a carer to a parent who was sectioned &amp; who is historically a narcissistic abusive fuck. Yeah me who can barely can take care of myself on a good day is now the person stuck with taking care of the individual who was the sole cause of pain &amp; terror for me every single day of my life for 19 years straight &amp; now almost every second of my time belongs to them. Some truly sick cosmic joke, no? 

Now that I think about I think writing this all out might have been not such a great idea. I thought it's make feel better? Lighter? Something idk. Funnily enough it's kinda doing the opposite though. 

It's just embedding into my brain how fucked I am overall. Like really what is the point? I'm just stuck in this hellhole (the one in my mind &amp; the living situation) with no possible way out. Like what do I hope to gain out of this anyway? It's not like it's going to fix me or change my life. So why is this bothering me so much? 

I'm like torn between giving up this charade of trying to be somebody I'm not &amp; never will be and also maybe just maybe trying  to do something for me &amp; also not giving up for once in my life. Ugh typed out like this it's sound so stupid &amp; dramatic &amp; cringe af (thank the powers that be for anonymous internet formus). 

Anyway I don't know what to do. I don't even know why I wrote this. I especially have no idea what I expected to get out of it. 

Since almost everything seems to be stacked against me maybe I should just let it go? Am I just making my life more difficult trying to fight against it? I mean I gave it a fair try right? Almost 6 months. I can at least day I tried, right? &amp; that it just wasn't meant to be?

If you'd told me back in Jan that I would do even half the runs (even as pathetically on &amp; off as they've been) for last 6 months I would have ugly snort laughed in your face so hard I'd probably would've ended up with some permanent damage. But tbf 6 months on what have I really gained?  I've barely progressed at all. So really what is the point?

So annoyed at how slow, how fat and useless I am. How the f**k am I going to run a 5k on 31 July? I'm just so demoralised, I want to give up. I've never got this far before and I just can't seem to get my head straight..
Sorry for rant..  BTW its not my wife's fault - my head is a dick sometimes

I was considering working on the 5k to 10k program just because it conditions you to running for longer periods of time.  There's no way in the world I can see myself covering 10k in 60 mins.  I can 100% see myself running for 60 mins though given enough time to work up to it.

58,Should a stranger stop you on a run to offer advice? Okay or not okay?,"Context: I completed Week 6 Day 1 yesterday, all going pretty well.

I was in the middle of the 8 minute run section, and had turned at the end of a path to run back. I was about to pass a man walking his dog when he suddenly gestured and said something to me. I muted my headphones and asked him to repeat what he'd said.

He started telling me something about running flat-footed and how it was harder. I felt a little flustered and just told him, I know, but I'm just getting back into running and I can sort my form out later. I actually wanted to shout 'I KNOW, OKAY.'

In truth, I was quite tired yesterday, and didn't have the energy to worry about heel-striking, just to get through the scheduled run. Once I'd slowed down a bit and had a walking break, I was back to better form.

I've never been approached like that by anyone on a run - had plenty of other people say hello or smile - so I was a bit taken aback. I did also felt a bit angry and defensive? Like, I felt I had to suddenly explain to a stranger that I'm not a beginner, but am having to relearn how to run after a very long break.

After a little while, I didn't feel so angry about it and supposed that he thought he was just being helpful. Of course he didn't know anything about me.

But on the other side of things, I'd never cause someone to stop their workout to offer unsolicited advice. I like the little bubble I'm in when I run, and I'm trying to recapture what I used to be able to do. When I get into a place where I'm comfortably running along, my mind can do its own thing. It was very disruptive to have someone break into that. 

I suppose I just felt weirdly rattled. It's not going to stop me, of course, but I don't particularly want strangers to stop and talk to me when I'm on a run, so now I'll wonder about it happening again.

I did also have the thought that he may have felt comfortable giving me the advice because I'm female. Would he have stopped a male stranger to do the same thing? Have any men here been stopped by other men in a similar way?

So, what do you think? Has this ever happened to you? Do you think it's okay to stop someone during a run to give them advice? Any opinions, please!",C25K,1561474232,catmanchew,17,5,True,2019-06-25

I'm a new runner that has spent the past eight months doing cardio on an elliptical and a few exercises like pushups and planks, and eating better in general for overall ""healthiness"". I decided to try my hand at running the past few weeks and saw this C25K program.


Using the Strava app, I was able to push myself to a little gold badge for 31 minutes for a 5k. I'm trying to figure out where should I start. Do I start somewhere in the middle of the C25K program, or do I move to a more challenging program?",C25K,1561476463,siul1979,7,2,True,2019-06-25

64,Form cues that helped me,"I'm not an experienced runner by any means (completed c25k 3 years ago, stopped running, now doing it again) but recently I heard some form cues that have really helped me and I wanted to share them because for all the time I've spent reading this sub and r/running, I had never seen these tips and they really helped me. If I'm wrong please correct me because like I said I'm not an expert. 

**Tip 1: Don't focus on what part of your foot is striking the ground (heel, midfoot, etc). Instead focus on your foot landing underneath your body.**

When I focus on my foot landing underneath me, I automatically start landing on the middle/front of my foot. If my foot lands in front of me, I land on my heel. I can definitely feel it more in my calves when I run with my feet underneath me. 

**Tip #2: Take short, quick strides.**

This was tough for me since I have long legs, but it goes hand in hand with #1. Your steps should be tiny but fast. This does not mean to run faster! If you're getting out of breath, take tinier steps. Some apps track your cadence, so if you're paying attention, aim for 165+ steps/minute during your run time. 

**Tip #3: The floor is lava.**

Get your feet off the ground quickly. This doesn't mean run faster, just that you're not smashing your foot into the ground on every step. Keep it light.

I'm in training for a 5k and i'm running it in around 44mins every 2 days. I've hit a wall and no matter how hard I try I cannot get any better than that. I have got under that time by a few mins and then over but can't make any real progress to see any improvement. I have been running for a month/6 weeks and mixing this with weight training.

- i had physical therapy
- went to a lot of docs 
- rested a lot 
- did all the exercises for stretching and strengthen 
-changed my shoes 3 times  ( got now saucony isofits)
- i got orthopedic insoles
- icing the shins 
- foam rolling

14,Had to stop midway at W1D1,"Just started this program after seeing a lot of people I know doing marathons this summer, and I thought running would be one of the best things I could add to my life. I'm already 28 and very out of shape. I'm not morbidly obese but my bf% is over 25 and I'm 240lbs and really don't want to climb any higher.

Anyway so I got myself all hyped up and for the first time in a long time I came home from work and immediately went to exercise after. I have a lot of anxiety, but if I just sort of turn off my brain, focus on one thing (in this case my feet), and [essentially doing this](https://youtu.be/dD1PXqcYqu0?t=33) I forced myself outside and just went with it.

I was doing fine but my area is very hilly and I accidentally started one of my jog cycles down a steep hill, bouncing my spine along the way. That pain wasn't too bad, but it did sort of give me a muscle cramp later on. What really killed it for me is after I got to my 4th cycle I had to stop jogging because I had both shin splints (which I knew was coming) and a new pain in my lower calf that sort of felt like it went in a ring around my ankle; basically just above the joint. It even hurt when I slowed down to walk. I think it's just because I've been so inactive all this time, but I'm also using some busted worn out 10 year-old Adidas.

I'm sure that will go away in time but I managed to make it to 2km today and walked back another 1km while doing short sprints of jogs along the way.

I just did W8D2, and I made it 2.37 miles in the 28 minutes. 

I kept track of my time in W7D3, and noticed at the halfway point I was ahead by about a minute and a half (was at 1.25 miles with 14 minutes to go, so 11 minutes for 1.25 miles), but then I only got to 2.2 with the remaining 14 minutes, making my mile time considerably slower. On W8D1, I noticed something similar. I reached halfway point with 14 minutes to go (1.4 miles in 14 minutes), but then only got to 2.3 with the next 14 minutes. Today I didn't track my time at the halfway point but I was at about 1.5 with 11:30 to go, and I only made it to 2.4. 


I think I might be going to fast when I first start. I kind of need to, I really need to hype myself up for running (because it's awful lol), so I kinda get an adrenaline dump at the beginning and have a longer stride with a quicker pace (I'm not sprinting, just picking my legs up more). This last for the first few minutes, then I slow down to a more comfortable stride but continue to go. Once I reach like 8-10 minutes left my stride is definitely shortened and it's embrassing compared to the pace I was keeping.

But for those who don‚Äôt:

WALK

I believe that everyday you push yourself to do at least 12,000 steps. So even in those weeks when you have no motivation to run, it keeps your fitness up. 

Walking is literally my saviour. If you don‚Äôt at least continue walking you‚Äôll reset back to unfit extremely fast.

So walk! It‚Äôs relaxing, it‚Äôs easy and it‚Äôs great for you!

Keep it up guys :)",C25K,1560456839,swarla,0,14,True,2019-06-13

36,Today I graduated C25K and I wanted to share my journey though the program!,"I was like a lot of people who have posted on this subreddit with comments like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been able to run more than a minute‚Äù and thoughts of ‚Äúno way I can do this‚Äù constant plagued my mind. I‚Äôve always been more of a swimmer however due to recently losing my job I‚Äôve had to cut out my membership and decided I still wanted that cardio goodness in my life and after bringing it up with my housemate she suggested I start c25k. She knew how much I hated running due to previous conversations but I‚Äôm glad she suggested it. I also have another friend who is currently training and running the spartan and obstacle course races and she made them out to be really fun and challenging, I thought they looked amazing so made my choice to begin training for them to hopefully do next year.

There was/ is my motivation so I began the program, and i am still incredibly surprised to admit that I absolutely love running now and am super excited to start the b210k. it‚Äôs helped me out in so many different aspects of my life. The first and major one is I suffer from ADHD and for years it has kept me up with restless thoughts of ideas and drawings I want to do when it‚Äôs 3am and I just really need to sleep. Now I‚Äôm just tired and exhausted that I fall asleep pretty quickly. Secondly the dopamine hit is absolutely fantastic and never believed people when they said they got runners high but my goodness that sense of achievement for hitting them goals and pushing yourself to the limits, on my rest days I get jealous now of runners going past me! Third point, it‚Äôs gotten me more active as a whole. Even on my rest days I‚Äôll try and find time to go for an hour or two walk which are extra calories to burn for my weight loss program.

And speaking of rest days I actually, and forgive the pun, speed ran through the program. Let me explain, After the first couple of weeks of doing c25k I was absolutely loving it and just wanted to run more, however I didn‚Äôt want to hurt myself and risk losing my progress. I brought it up with my housemate and she said as long as I‚Äôm not actually in pain and hurting whilst I‚Äôm running then it‚Äôs ok for me to to run. So instead of doing run day, rest day, run day, rest day etc. I instead kicked up the gears and do run day, run day, Rest day, run day, run day, rest day. So instead of taking me 9 weeks, I‚Äôve actually done it in 6, and I can‚Äôt begin to explain how proud I am of myself for sticking through this and just smashing it!

I‚Äôve been losing a decent amount of weight with this and I even had to buy some new shorts half way through the program as I almost ran out of them on one of my runs haha I‚Äôm just overall more happy, fit and productive after starting c25k and I feel like I‚Äôm able to channel all this restlessness adhd energy into something meaningful.

Today was my graduating run and I ended up clearing 5.28 kilometres in 31 minutes! Sorry for the wall of text I just really wanted to share my story and hopefully gives people some motivation (and mostly disclipine) to finish this amazing program and feel just as good as I do. You can do it!

44,"W8D3 done, very weird change today","So today was my last day on the program (besides the final 5k run) so woo hoo! 

Something weird happened after I tried a few things. So I've been asking about pacing lately, because I haven't been making close to the right distance for the time (I really wanna do a 24 minute 5k, I'm barely at 2.5 miles in half an hour). I figured my problem was that I was rushing out of the gate too much, and slowing down considerably as I went on. A lot of y'all told me not to worry, just keep going and the speed will come. But I'm stubborn so I tried something, with a few other things, that seemed to make a difference, although not in the way I thought

1. I was slower out of the gate. Instead of letting my adrenaline pump be to go a quicker than normal pace for the first few minutes, I just slowed myself and was a bit more bouncy, it was closer to a jog than a run. I was able to keep this pace and even speed up as I went.
2. I focused more on activating my quads and glutes at certain points. I always feel like I'm putting too much work in with my calves and not enough with my other leg muscles, so at times id actively think ""flex your quads, now your glutes, now your quads..."" I'd keep them tensed for a few minutes and it helped me glide quite a bit more and made my stride so much smoother.
3. I got distracted a bit. I always like to think out little scenarios in my head, it helps keep my mind off of how blisteringly painful everything feels when I'm exhausted. Thanks to the first two, this was easier.
4. I didn't look at the clock until 4 minutes to go. This didn't improve my pace but at the same time, since I had no gauge in time, I had to focus alot harder on keeping a pace that I could keep up indefinitely, considering I didn't know when I needed to stop. Once I checked and I was at 4 minutes, I was able to push harder and achieve a quicker pace than what I started with.
5. The weather was nice. This wasn't my doing but I usually run with a hoodie, so at 65¬∞ F (18¬∞ C) it was a perfectly sunny and cool temp. 
6. I focused more on keeping good posture once my lower back really started hurting. This helped my stride too


Now, my time didn't improve, I added another .1-.2 miles with the extra 2 minutes, like I figured. 

But once I stopped, I noticed I wasn't nearly as tired. Even on W8D1 and W8D2, at the end I was still gasping for breath and having to control my breathing. But today, I finished and felt fine. I was still breathing heavier than normal, but it was much easier to breath in and hold it. I was walking fine and I felt fine. Honestly if I was forced to I could've gone another mile if need be. My body isn't as sore and just 10 minutes after my breathing is like I never even ran at all. 


It feels great being at such a healthy state endurance wise, I'd be 100% happy if I could get my speed up, but I'll see where I am at the end of summer. For now I'm not sure what I'll do, run the 5 k Monday and then just keep running it every other day? Or maybe start the 10 k trainer.

I'm 23F for reference (24 on Tuesday, woot woot!). 

So I used to be a very avid runner and never stopped completely. The main reason I mostley stopped and switched to different forms of cardio was joint pain (hips, mostly but also knees and ankles). So I'm on W2D3 and I haven't had a hard time at all getting through the runs as far as my fitness goes, but today I had to stop early because both of my ankles were absolutely killing me. I've always been a treadmill runner but the last couple weeks I've been running outside on the sidewalk. I can only assume that has something to do with it. There are a few hills but nothing excessive. I currently have underarmour tennis shoes...which aren't the best, I know, but they're decent and I'm poor.

I don't know what I'm looking for but I'm incredibly frustrated because I've very much come to look forward to my runs as I used to and now this stupid joint pain is back with a vengeance. Has anyone else experienced this?",C25K,1560556919,ms211064,2,5,True,2019-06-14

I did a 4 mile walk afterwards which resulted in a pace of 16'09"". I've never walked that fast on a treadmill before &amp; I don't know what it is about exercising outside that really steps my game up but anyways, how do I slow down when jogging?

First jog tends to always feel great, the second one slightly less, &amp; by the third i'm just nearly over it. How did you guys slow down?",C25K,1560638250,thewitchof-el,3,1,True,2019-06-15
70,W6D2 - Seem to be developing pacing issues?,"Today was my W6D2 run today and I completed it - sort of.  Had to stop with about 8.5mins running remaining, but in my determination to finish after a few extra mins walking I ran for another 3 then had to stop again, but after another couple of minutes walking I gritted my teeth and got through the final 6 minutes.  Having looked at my strava stats, I possibly went out a little too hard and might try again tomorrow.

My question is, did anyone else develop pacing issues after the big run of W5R3?  I also had to redo W6D1 after one failed attempt, although my legs were still pretty heavy from the 20min run previously.  When I tried again I managed a quicker than usual pace and ran my furthest yet at 3.5km.  Now that I am ""fitter"" I feel like my ""comfortable pace"" is slightly quicker than it used to be, therefore when I start runs now, I feel absolutely fine for the first 7, 8, even 10mins, but quickly start to get more and more tired.

Another question I have is, does anyone find it really hard to slow down mid-run?  When I think to myself ""I need to slow down here"", I feel like I need to alter my stride stride pattern and I end up just running the same quick speed until I inevitably need to stop.

Anyway, while the cardio side is way easier, I'm struggling with really bad calf pain during and after my runs. It's really stopping me from running the best that I feel I could as the pain is really bad, like a burning pain. Mostly in my right leg as it's weaker.

I'm doing a slow jog followed by various dynamic stretches for about 5mins, then do the c25k workout mostly on grass. As part of the 5min cool down I walk home and then stretch again for at least 10mins. Still dynamic but with some static stretches thrown in too. I try to focus on my Achilles and calf muscles as much as I can, in addition to my hips and shoulders. 

Any ideas on how to reduce calf pain? I imagine its at least partly because my job is sedentary and desk based and I'm definitely not very flexible. I've tried running on my toes/ball of feet as much as I can but also heel strike to mix it uolp. I have also tried a few different running trainers as I've got 3 pairs - Adidas ultraboost, under armour ones and a pair of Nike flyknits.

79,W9D3 Done!! A few reflections and tips for those starting out,"Hey all! This is my first time posting, but I've been actively checking this subreddit the whole time I was doing the program, and seeing everyone working hard  to reach their goals always helped me to get inspired to keep going. So if you posted, or you're thinking of doing the program and posting, thank you!

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit about me: 30 year old male.  I was never obese, but I've always been on the chubby side. My lifestyle is extremely sedentary, desk job and all. When it comes to sports, I liked leisurely riding my bike now and then but I've never been a runner, and was never able to run or even jog for more than 100-200 meters my whole life. When I for some reason got the itch to try out running as a hobby I found it really hard to find testimonials and experiences from people at my starting point. It was always ""I haven't run in a while but I used to run back in high school"" or ""on my first day of couch to 5k I ran 2 miles"", almost never just someone really starting out at 0 like me, hence why I wanted to make this post upon completing.

&amp;#x200B;

Weeks 1 to 3 felt by far the hardest. There's so much that goes into just learning to move your body in the right way for running. Looking back now it's crazy but those 1 minute running 1.5 minute walking intervals were super challenging, and I was definitely exhausted by the end of each session.

&amp;#x200B;

Weel 4 I dreaded the most going into it. That's when it started to feel like I was really getting into it, and running 5 minutes straight was a scary prospect. In the end, because I dreaded it so much I made sure to go extra slow, so it ended up actually being one of the easier weeks. Upon finishing week 4 I wasn't scared of any of the following weeks anymore. I now knew they are all doable.

&amp;#x200B;

Weeks 5 to 9 honestly all felt about the same intensity, but more satisfying because you can finally keep running for longer stretches and not have to stop and walk! Week 8 felt a little tougher for some reason, but it was fine.

&amp;#x200B;

tip1: Don't be a hero and try to skip rest days. You're likely to injure yourself, or burn out. Don't be one of those people that self-sabotage!

&amp;#x200B;

tip2: I saw someone here say once to ""become a turtle runner"" and that's the strategy I used to go through each week. I didn't care if people way older than me passed me by with ease on my running route. Too much pride will mess you up when doing couch to 5k. You're a complete beginner, so it makes zero sense to hold yourself to a standard of someone advanced. Noone who sees you running cares what you're doing or how fast you're going, I just want everyone who feels anxious  about running outside to realize that. It doesn't matter anyway, you're out there getting it done!! That's a million times better than not doing anything because you're self conscious. This program is all about longevity and making it through to the end, not about looking cool while you're doing it. That comes later! Or not at all, if you let your fear stop you.

Last night I felt amazing, the weather was great, it finally rained after a week long heat wave, I wanted to do the w5d3 and run 20 minutes. I went very slowly, but lasted 10 minutes before my heart rate was out of control (over 165). I walked a bit and ran again, but not even 8 minutes. 

I am overweight, with BMI of almost 29. I go to the gym 1-2 times a week, but always have a rest day after (otherwise i get too tired and everything hurts). 
I eat very well, no processed crap or soda, lots of veggies and meat, 99% of my food I cook myself. I like butter and home-made desserts are my biggest vice, but every time I check, I hit my macros ok. 
I sleep 7-8 hours a day, I walk 7k steps on the bad no-running day, but often it‚Äôs over 10k. I don‚Äôt run after meals and usually eat 3-4 hours before run. I drink lots of water.

It's the down days that are the problem, I am totally lacking energy and pretty much falling asleep standing up by the end of the day. Last night I slept for a solid seven hours and I am sitting typing this before I leave for work and I could in all honesty crawl right back into bed now.

This weekend though, I tried a longer fast--my goal was 70h.

When I got to the trail, I felt great and decided to try a very slow jog. It felt great! For the first half of the run that was the BEST run yet--I found an easy, comfortable pace, and I could go very slow without feeling any effort. It was just as if I were walking!

I really wanted to achieve a slow, enjoyable jog. Well, today, for the first 1.25miles I HAD IT.

The second half got a bit harder, and I really should have stopped and repeated the day. But I continued and overall I felt fine when I finished. I'm glad I did. 

I'm really looking forward to Week 8 and to finding my slow but comfortable run again. I won't run past 36h fasted though--I don't think that's optimal.

92,Progress...And Lack There Of,"Today, I'm about to finish my second week of C25K. I keep telling myself I'm not doing this to lose weight. I'm not doing this to look good. I'm doing this for my heart. For my health. To get stronger. To be able to play with my friends without being winded and to be able to hold a conversation on the stairs.

But I stepped in the scale today. Old habits die hard. And I've gained 2 lbs. With more exercise than I've done in weeks, I've gained more weight than I have in the last month of an unhealthy lifestyle. My resting heart rate has actually gotten worse, not better. And all that confidence I felt finishing my runs imploded when I had to do it in the gym and saw people judging the fat girl's walk-run system.

I know muscle adds weight and all that, but there's no way 2 weeks makes that much of a difference in muscle...does it? How do you stay motivated through sheer lack of progress, or even retrograde movement?",C25K,1560784175,Brain_Sci3nc3s,2,1,True,2019-06-17

98,Finished!,"Today I finally got to the ""run 5k"" part of the program!

Although I didn't run the 5k, I still did the half hour of running, and set a new PR of 2.6 miles in half an hour! Just like 3.6 roentgens, not great, not terrible 


I'm not sure what I'll do now. I'll continue to run every other day, I suppose during my next run I'll just use a stop watch and run the full 5k and see what my time is, at my current pace it'll be about 35 minutes, which is about 11 minutes over the time I really wanna be at some day (my goal was the end of August, 11 minutes in two and a half months is probably impossible, I'll see how I feel once I lose the remainder of this fat).


My biggest piece of advice to anyone who's starting is

1.) Slow down. I only recently started doing this, but keep a consistent pace. A mistake I made for a while was starting off with long powerful strides, getting the first mile done in like 8-9 minutes, then being so winded the next mile and a half would take up 20 minutes. You're gonna want to be comfortable enough where half way through the run you could keep a casual conversation going with someone.

2.) If you have to, change your trail. I first ran through a small park with a steep hill, and didn't like it. Running up that hill multiple times just made me despise my run, and it was such a small park that the location got boring quick. I changed to a relatively flat stretch of long road and the change of scenery along with the flat gradient made the run a lot smoother. 

3.) (Most important) Just keep going. Almost every day for me I'd be a minute or two in and think ""oh God this sucks, I honestly think I might quit today. Don't worry, you did several days without quiting, it's okay to quit today"". But it's not okay. It's okay to be afraid of failure, it's okay to acknowledge that quitting voice in your head. But it's not okay to quit, it's not, it's the biggest betrayl you could make to yourself. Don't listen to anyone or anything who praises you for quiting, who tells you it's okay, just as long as you attempted it. If you quit, get sick to your stomach about it, use that to drive you. When you're a mile in and your sides hurt and you're gonna puke, use that pain to drive you, think about anyone watching who might say ""oh they'll never finish this run"" and finish the run, go at a snail's pace if you have to, but do not quit, do not. If you fail, like I have several times , if you don't make the time or your pace just drops off, that's alright, that's not the same as quiting, you can learn from that and take steps to make sure it doesn't happen. But do not quit, don't give up, because when it comes down to it, you're the only one you can count on to keep yourself going, and if you quit on you, then what's the point of even trying anything. Don't be a sad sack anymore, refuse that quiting nature and rise above. I'm a terrible runner, I'm a top heavy, duck walking,  flat footed chunk man, and I did it.

32,Dynamic stretching before a run - any recommended stretches?,"Hello all

Context: I've just started Week 5, all seems to be going well if slowly.

I want to talk about dynamic stretching.

When I used to run some years back, a gym instructor was really helpful with giving me advice as I started to get better and run further distances. For example, encouraging to do a more in-depth warm-up. So I would:

Leave the house at a very light jog for a few minutes, then slow into a brisk walk for 5 minutes or so, until I reached the park I'd usually run through. I could alternate between brisk walk and a light jog if I liked. Once I got there, I would do some dynamic stretches on the grass. She taught me the difference between stretches that were going to help warm up my muscles and anticipate movement, and static stretches which would help me to cool down, relieve muscle tension and prepare for less activity. It's so obvious now, but before that, no-one had ever explained this properly to me.

Doing this became invaluable and really helped with shin splints which I had for a short while, plus general performance and recovery.

However, it's been a long time since I did those dynamic stretches and I'm wondering if anyone here has any input - do you do this before a run, and which stretches do you do? Now the runs are starting to get a bit longer with C25K, I think it would be beneficial for me to start doing them again. But I can't really remember them very well!

What should I do now ? Stick to 30mins and up the speed ? Up the time with the same pace ? Move to another program altogether ?

I started C25K about 7 weeks ago, and I'm amazed at the progress that happens so quickly!! Cardiovascularly I've felt like I could keep going indefinitely since the beginning of week four!! But I think there are some problems with my form that I'm not sure how to correct.
When I was a kid, I had a problem with turning my feet in when I walked. I don't think I ever fully corrected the problem, because when I was in marching band, I was always called out for not roll stepping correctly with my right foot. When I'm running, I notice the same problem. I roll the outside of my foot in instead of rolling my foot from heel to toe, and to compensate I try and turn my feet outwards.
I think as a result my form makes running feel very unnatural, and for the rest of the jog my shins, calves, and feet ache. The pain starts five minutes into the run and steadily gets worse, and it just feels like a muscle spasm getting worse for the rest of the time.
Does anyone have any advice for form correction? I didn't have muscle fatigue until I got to the eight minute intervals, and I've decided to just keep running the twenty minute run until I can find a way to fix it or it goes away.

I think I finally understand what people mean about finding their pace. When I finished the cool down, it felt like I hadn't worked as hard because it was shorter then w2 by a few minutes, and fewer intervals. I really wanted to feel that magical click moment of those three minute runs one more time, so I did a short circuit around one of the trails in the park I run, and looking at my watch after it was a four minute jog to do that.

I'm already fighting myself not to go out running more often, but I don't want to injure myself so I'm keeping to 3 days a week. I do also do resistance training with a trainer 2-3 days a week, and sometimes do 15 minutes of walking/jogging on the treadmill to warm up for that.

26,W4D1 Really had to push to finish the last 5 minute run.,"This was a tough one. They really ramped up the running to walking ratio compared to W3D3 and it took a lot of willpower to get through both of the 5 minute runs. The 3 minute runs weren't too bad.

31:30 4.2k

21:30 minutes 3.1k for the non-warmup/cooldown section

38:10 Finished by walking the rest of the 5k. Personal best by a pretty large margin, around 90 seconds.

I've been back at the gym for 6 weeks. I like rowing/biking so I haven't been doing 3/week of this so far. One thing that I've felt during the training, is how progress can feel both fast and at the same time excruciatingly slow. When I started, I was walking fit, where I could walk a full 5k at 4mph but running even a minute was tough. A month later I can run for 5 minutes straight but the pace is still a slow 11:10 per mile. Clear tangible progress but the real goal still feels far far into the future.

I'm a Senior math major that works in a very non-math field currently, and the overwhelming majority of my coworkers actively despise math. Something I realized today while pushing myself through the last 5 minute run was the parallels between what I tell people that say they are bad at math and my current fitness situation. The way to get good at math is a 3 step process.

1. Want to get good at math.
2. Start with the basics, it all builds on the previous material and if the foundation is weak it will make things much harder later.
3. Do math. What is hard today will be very easy in 6 months.

There really isn't any magic to learning math for most people. Most people that struggle with a class like Calculus don't tend to have problems with the new Calculus material, their algebra and pre-calc understanding isn't where it needs to be, fix that and the Calculus is easy.

It certainly helped me through the last couple minutes and reminded myself I'm not at the Calculus stage of my fitness journey yet and that's ok.",C25K,1558721383,bset222,2,11,True,2019-05-24

I‚Äôve done up to W1D2 (doing it every other day) and I‚Äôm worried that maybe I‚Äôm not doing it right? Like I said, I‚Äôm pretty out of shape, so I‚Äôm trying not to over exert myself and put myself off of the program all together.

Is that defeating the purpose? I definitely finish each days workout sweaty but I don‚Äôt feel completely exhausted or super sore or anything. Should I be pushing myself harder? I‚Äôm just worried about going ‚Äútoo hard‚Äù and then feeling like I can‚Äôt sustain the three day a week system, or even being too tired to finish a workout. 

I‚Äôm also thinking about doing each week twice to help make sure I‚Äôm really building endurance and not pushing myself too hard too fast. (Part of my being overweight and out of shape is that I know I have a tendency to feel discouraged and give up when I get tired quickly trying to workout). But I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm defeating the purpose of the C25K by going way too slow.

62,"Just finished the program, but I'm so slow?","Hey guys,

I just finished the program, but according to a GPS tracking app, I only do 2 miles in half an hour as opposed to 3.1.  How should I go about running thr full 5k now that the program is done?",C25K,1558915637,OutrageousShame,10,10,True,2019-05-26
63,W5D3 done!,"I did a thing :)

I would normally run on Saturday morning but I took the Sunday afternoon option because I did my first 24hrs fast yesterday, and barely managed 1,000 calories when it was over. So today I waited until my normal eating window resumed so I wouldn't run on just that. 

As usual, it proved ""easier"" than expected, because it really is a mental game. The first 10 minutes were great. The last 5 were *longer*. But I did it. Every time I thought about stopping, I reminded myself that if I did, I would have to do it again, whereas if I completed the run, next week would be easier. Besides, my ego wouldn't let me stop.

So now I'm all proud of myself and enjoying my new favorite post-run shake (plain protein powder, almond-cashew-cocoa milk, and peanut powder) with the glow of the one who just saved the universe or something.

Also I don't know why but my pace is always higher than it was two years ago when I was running regularly-ish, although I feel like a heavy, pounding snail.

64,I jogged for 30 minutes non-stop today???,"It was on a treadmill, and only at 5.5-6.0 speed, and it was not doing the C25K program, however, I have tried the program in the past and never gotten past week 3. I am confused as to how I was able to achieve this as I am 96.3kg and although I work retail and am on my feet a lot, and go for many walks/bike rides with my partner, I generally feel unfit. I think it may be due to having been trying to jog too fast previously (7.0 or 8.0 speed). I want to try the C25K program again, but is it okay to focus on getting through it as opposed to the speed I'm moving? According to my Fitbit I had moved 4.5km today (which is primarily the workout as I got out of bed and went straight to the gym), and that included my warm-up of 5 minutes and the cool-down of I think 4 minutes (because I accidentally pulled the emergency stop at one point and restarted everything xD).

66,Wk1D1 Complete,"Had a lot of fun doing it, I've not exercised at all in about 8-9 years and hopefully this can be the start of something good. The only thing I'm a little gutted about was I bought new trainers for this and my feet hurt like mad when running, the pain stops as soon as I take abit of pressure off so I know it's nothing to worry about but it makes the run a little less pleasant.

72,Completed Week 4 Day 1 today- slow and steady,"Just completed Week 4 Day 1!  I wasn't worried about the 5 minute runs until I actually headed out and then started wondering how hard it was going to be. Then I felt nervous.

It was hard, but by no means impossible. I also notice that my pace seems to pick up and steady in the last minute or so of each run. Definitely need those 3 minute runs and the breaks though!

I'm personally running this week by week, avoiding repetition and just trying to keep my pace slow and steady. I may have to repeat a run or two because I'm away for the large part of a week in what should be Week 6, but we'll see.

I also have some small hills and rocky ground on my trails. I try not to time them for the running sections, but this is rather tricky, so some uphill running is generally guaranteed.

I know Week 5 is where it really starts to step up so I'm a bit nervous. How did you guys feel at the end of Week 4? I'm feeling good right now, but I do feel like it's going to become much more difficult after this week...",C25K,1558968670,catmanchew,12,11,True,2019-05-27

81,Signed up for my first race,"So I started throwing around in my head the idea of running when I was seeing a lot of advertising for breast cancer runs in my area last year, right after my mother-in-law was diagnosed. My partner wanted badly to be able to do those kinds of runs for his mother, but with his disabilities he probably wouldn't be able to, and I really wanted to be able to do so for him, and for her. Over the winter it slipped from my mind, as I was dealing with my own health issues and then recovering from a back injury that happened as a culmination of me letting myself get so out of shape and weakened muscles due to terrible posture, plus twisting wrong while moving a patient. After I recovered with physical therapy, I had more motivation then I've ever felt to get back into shape. I began working with a trainer doing resistance training, and just started c25k as well. I was looking for a run to sign up for, knowing that once I had myself registered, I'd have no excuses to give up and stop, knowing I had a goal to work towards. 

Well now I'm registered for my first race at the beginning of August! I chose the one I did because it was close by and at the farm I had a CSA with last year, but realized afterwards that the proceeds for it benefit the cancer patient fund in my area. It seems my goals have come full circle and I just can't wait to be a part of this race and have my partner see me cross the finish line!",C25K,1558982098,RhaegarTiberius,4,11,True,2019-05-27

86,Pretty sure I'm not ready at all for my 5k this weekend but I realized I really have made amazing progress.,Ran today in extremely muggy weather with a 20-25 mph blowing right in my face.  It was like running in a sauna.  I still managed 20 mins without a lot of difficulty and ultimately gave up not because I was worn out but because I was just fed up of dealing w/the muggy weather.  I ran 2 miles at a pace of about 12:30/mile.  That doesn't get me to the 35 min 5k that's my stretch goal but it's close.  Back in Feb when I started this I never would've been able to even run 20 mins period.  I need to figure out how to toughen up my mental game and maybe figure out a better way to carry my phone/wallet/keys etc....  I have been using a running belt but that keeps my shirt stuck to my skin and I don't get any ventilation which is probably making me even hotter.  I may go out this evening when it's cooler and try something else.,C25K,1558993057,agreeingstorm9,1,9,True,2019-05-27

88,Calling potential fitness buddies - anyone using Garmin Connect?,"Hello everyone,

I have two kinds of people around me in day to day life, those that dont care about fitness at all, or those that are so far above my level that its disconcerting.

I was wondering if anyone here used garmin connect?  It has a buddy system where you can see each others activities, comment, cheer them on and so on.

Seems like a great idea, if you have the right buddies to share with.

Maybe such a group exists but if not, if anyone would like a bit of mutual encouragement, hit me up.  We all know it's not easy getting off that couch!

I've had a look on Garmin and groups do exist, but seem a bit random, so I guess I'm proposing a redditors group for C25k with maybe a bit of other fitness stuff tacked on.

I'm a beginner and I'm 40, with plenty of excess bulk to lose.

I'd love to hear from anyone who's interested.  I'm hoping it will make the difference between forcing myself (and others) off the couch, and not.
